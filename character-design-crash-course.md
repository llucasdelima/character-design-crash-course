## Introduction

Here is an intuitive, straight-forward approach to self-directed character design practice for illustrators and animation artists. In this document you'll find a series of exercises, each one is presented with a particular design style to reference, there's instructions to follow, and guides for you to create a new character that matches that style.

<!-- 👈👈👈 Quick links to each topic and chapter in the left column. -->

Further down you'll see the setup for these **12 assignments**, with a total of 32 different established design styles to learn from. For each assignment you'll have a section called 'Support Material', these are external links to design packs, tutorials, and articles aimed at giving you more knowledge on certain topics from a wide range of sources. There's also some insightful character design history scattered through this site.

If you already know all about how **design sheets** work, along with the process and theory behind making them, and you just want to get straight to the practice exercises, then skip ahead to [Assignment# 1](#assignment-1) and get straight to work! Otherwise, keep reading

through the chapters below, to learn about the essential foundations and techniques behind the craft of character design for animation.

This document is for learning & self-training in the art and process of character design. Throughout your career you will upgrade those fundamentals with new and relevant techniques. Just like learning the piano, cooking, standup-comedy, or carpentry - you begin with the foundational skills, and you build up from there. Over time, with practice, you will gain more applicable and significant skill sets to add in your toolbelt. There's also hundreds of external links on this site that lead you to various tutorials for you to watch, listen, read and learn from.

To be a character designer for TV/film animation, you must be able to diversify into a variety of art styles. This course is specific to 2D animation, however, most of these methods and techniques also apply to character design for 3D/CG productions, video game development, toy design, stop-motion films, and any other type of series & shorts for animated commercials, streaming, and media projects.

![image](./images/unnamed_1456.png)

By reverse-engineering a wide assortment of different character designs, you begin to develop fast and efficient analytical skills for knowing how to replicate a new character in the chosen visual style. This way you become more proficient in creating new characters in whatever design style that is needed for the production. You will begin to develop instincts on how to blend styles together and therefore create new styles for any productions in the future. The more you do this with different techniques, the more you start to recognize the patterns and arrangements used to create these designs. You will get faster at figuring out what makes a design work and how to reproduce it.

### What Does The Character Designer Do?

Character designers visualize and create the look of individual characters. They work from descriptions given to them by the art director, showrunner, or creative producer. These might include notes on a character's personality as well as physical traits. Early concept art or visual development work or online research/imagery may be used as reference or springboards to work from. They communicate the characters' personalities through their artwork of facial expressions, costuming, anatomy, scale/proportions, and physical poses.

![image](./images/unnamed_386.jpg)

By Adam Fay

Character designers also carry out research into exploring the anatomy and costuming of characters. They discover and use anything they can to inform their work. This role relies heavily on drawing ability, characters can be drawn on paper but usually created digitally, especially in the later stages and for their final format. Character designers create a variety of designs, usually including multiple versions for a single character.

![image](./images/unnamed_101.png)

In the beginning, character designers take inspiration from the script, character descriptions from the pitch deck, insight from the creator(s), and any provided concept art, using this to create the characters they're working on. They present these versions to the director or producer and address any of their feedback to achieve a result that they are happy with. In the early stages, very loose and rough quick sketches are made to ascertain where the design sensibilities may be, to essentially rehearse some visual concepts. Then they receive notes and comments to further narrow down the designs so they can be refined and eventually finalized.

![image](./images/unnamed_575.jpg)

Character designers create entire casts of characters that all must share the same aesthetics and look to have them all consistently appear to be from the same world.

![image](./images/unnamed_408.jpg)

By Rune Bennicke

Once a rough design has been completed & approved, character designers create model sheets, which show the character from different angles. In 3D animation, these will be used by the modelers as their guide to create the character sculpts and builds. In traditional animation, the animator uses the model sheets as reference to ensure each frame of animation is "on model" as the character is re-drawn frame by frame. In 2D puppet/rigged animation, the builders use the model sheets as direct reference to assemble and produce a finished rig for animators to use in their scenes to animate with. Storyboard artists will also refer to these designs while they visualize the scripts, to incorporate the models into their work as they lay out all the scenes.

### What is a Character Designer good at?

- **Drawing:** have a strong level of artistic and technical skill, be able to create work in a variety of styles showing a high attention to detail
- **Creativity:** use your imagination to come up with original and innovative ideas both for the artistic part of the designs and for resourceful problem-solving, and create work that sparks the director's imagination which helps to tell a story
- **Collaboration:** understand what the director wants and be able to take and act on feedback to alter your designs, while working well with other artists and designers
- **Understanding the Pipeline:** know the capabilities of the artists and animators that will take your work and use it, create designs appropriate for the medium and technology used on the production - be aware of the many design stages & review stages throughout the process
- **Watching / Analyzing Animations:** have a passion for the medium and a love of the industry - it doesn't matter if the production is for 2D or 3D/CG or stop-motion, the ability to research, collect, and gather reference and provide quick sketches is invaluable

![image](./images/unnamed_155.jpg)

![image](./images/unnamed_448.jpg)

A profession in character design for the animation field demands the artist to switch into different art direction styles all the time. The more you attempt and replicate other artists' design styles, the more you start to recognize the patterns and similarities that exist in all styles of production design for TV/film animation, and gradually you learn to apply elements of these learned styles & absorb the contents of your collected visual libraries to your own tool belt and skill sets.

Designing an animated character involves several steps. Begin with a concept that defines the character\'s personality, traits, and role in the story. Sketch out these rough ideas to explore different looks and explore various features. Refine the design with attention to proportions, details, and unique traits that make the character stand out.

![image](./images/unnamed_215.png)

Analyzing character art styles and re-creating them to match that same look, is the best way to accelerate the growth of your draftsmanship and your personal artistic range. This type of practice is the most efficient way to develop a long career as a designer and character development artist in animation. Improving your artistic skill levels comes with strong commitment and hundreds of hours of dedicated practice.

As we go through this process of [copying][cQNxukfFKq], tracing, breaking down, researching, analyzing and then producing designs of your own in these established styles - it will have you unlock advancements in your personal artistic growth and you will unconsciously absorb and learn new techniques.

![image](./images/unnamed_144.jpg)

By Patrick Schoenmaker

To help find and develop YOUR own style, you must first explore and test drive many others, as Skottie Young mentions [here][EyTpBXEpqy]. There's no single one perfect method to learn how to be a character designer. Follow your instincts, along with the opinions, experiences and instructions from various other artists. It's up to you to work hard, learn from other people's path, their mistakes, their advice, their wisdom, how they learned, what their approach is, and then discover what works best for you, by simply doing it, and practicing it.

![image](./images/unnamed_1278.png)

The word 'process' appears over 100 times in this document, and for good reason, because for YOU as a designer, it's arguably more important than the final product itself. This course will guide you along the way, showing you how to self-train and self-improve as an artist, putting you on the road to becoming a well-rounded and sought-after **character designer**.

Character designers can be employed by the head of production or the animation studio's producer, and they can be hired as freelancers, part-timers, full-timers, or as a more permanent resident of the studio, but usually (like all productions) it is contract-based work, where the length of your term depends on the design work available for the department you're in.

![image](./images/unnamed_302.png)

There's several types of designers:

- Character designer for 2D animation
- Character designer for 3D animation
- Character designer for stop-motion animation
- Character designer for live-action films & VFX
- Character designer for video games
- Character designer for branding and advertising
- Character designer for comics and graphic novels
- Character designer for mobile games and apps

Designers come from all sorts of backgrounds; [illustration][QVlLjuadXn], [storyboards][VZOpPJKqBq], [comics][VktAJdBGvk], and especially [2D animation][ydEUhhHIXW].

Being aware of the basics of how animation works is a good head start for being an effective character designer:

👉 Interview with character designer Justin Rodriguez [(1)][mmXijouoLY] [(2)][qrvLRKZUEd]

Like many aspects of animation, similar to storyboarding and writing, character design can feel like a fairly solitary job. Sort of like solving a large puzzle, you navigate through the process, trying many different things, until gradually, things start to look right, and feel right. Where some of the pieces seem to fit together, you start to make progress after many hours or days of experimenting and exploring, only to have some setbacks, and realize and it still isn't quite working. Until finally you have that "aha!" moment, it can hit suddenly, when you and others realize that it's working and the design is coming together.

![image](./images/unnamed_274.png)

There can be times where a client/director loves your first or second attempt, other times, you have lots of people needing to provide their input, opinions, and approvals, so it can take dozens of tries, with many, many versions before you slowly refine things to a final design. The work can sometimes feel very collaborative, other times very isolated. The end goals are always the same, to capture the essence of the character's personality in visual form.

![image](./images/unnamed_1050.png)\

Practicing a wide spectrum of established design styles will push you outside your artistic comfort zone, getting you to experiment with techniques that may sit far away from your own personal drawing preference.

To know **HOW** to break the rules, we must first **KNOW** the rules, and know them well. But most importantly; learning the principles makes you see how other characters are conceptualized and constructed. While learning their structure, visual language and the methods behind how they are built - you will inherit new techniques for achieving more striking and appealing designs. There\'s no better way to learn than by **_doing_**, so let\'s get started.

First off, let's grasp the language used in the process of Character Design for Animation...

### What is a Model Sheet?

A character design sheet, also known as a model sheet, character board, character rotation, character sheet, character pack, or character study; is a set of illustrations used as a guide for the appearance, poses, views, and gestures of an original character in animated film/series, comics, and video games. These drawings are later used as guides by storyboard artists, modelers, builders and animators as reference to bring the characters to life in the scenes the characters appear in.

To help get you started, here are a few tips on constructing character model sheets!

**Character Sheets** like these are a specific industry-standard format that communicates the design of a character. It can also be used to introduce potential investors to a cast of characters, tell us a little bit about their personalities and relationships, and give us a general sense of what the character looks like and how they might move or behave. These sorts of Character Model Sheets are used in virtually every entertainment field from game design to animation. As shown above, there can be many different types of templates, every studio/production has their own preference. There's no right or wrong way to make these sheets, as long as the information is there and clearly presented. Though they can be used in a variety of fields, all character sheets contain roughly the same information: Turnaround views, Expressions, Poses, and sometimes Color. They can go from very simple to quite detailed and elaborate.

![image](./images/unnamed_046.png)

Model sheets also show variations for different states for the character, most often for changes on hair style and clothing/costuming:

![image](./images/unnamed_066.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_303.jpg)

Model sheets also provide more details on specific parts and assets of the character, along with various angles and poses as well:

![image](./images/unnamed_210.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_514.png)

These model sheets are like visual guide documents, they are typically illustrated during the pre-production phase of a production for a film or animated series. In feature films, the concept art and visual development stage eventually lead to more final character design sheets to be properly made for the Builds team to use later on. In animated series, the design process is continuous throughout the production since there's many stages across each episode that needs to be made.

![image](./images/unnamed_713.jpg)

Getting to the model sheet stage can be long and arduous, often starting out with lots of explorations to find the correct combination of shapes and forms and proportions that most accurately depict the character's persona.

Beginning with research...

![image](./images/unnamed_1363.jpg)

Then refinements...

![image](./images/unnamed_738.jpg)

Then after starting over once or twice (or 10 times), a certain character with particular combinations of ph and physical attributes and proportions are picked out, and after many versions and iterations, a turnaround can be constructed...

![image](./images/unnamed_879.jpg)

For a TV/media animated series there's an on-going episodic design process, as new sets of character sheets are made for each new story as the scripts get written. When working collaboratively with art directors or production designers, all the characters in the film or series should have their own model sheet created by the character designer. Depending on how large scale the production is, this could be just one or two individuals creating the main characters, or it can be a whole team of artists working together to illustrate a large cast of characters. With multiple episodes always overlapping and many aspects of the design process needing to be made for each character, like _Turnaround Views, Expressions, Poses, Head Angles, Mouth Charts_ and _Color_ - there can be lots of coordination and organization needed in order to meet the needs of the production, along with a strict list of weekly deadlines for each episode to keep everything always progressing forward and on track with the schedule.

**How to use a Model Sheet**:

Character design sheets should be used as a guide for any members of the creative team who will need to work with the character. They should have a simple layout that is easy to understand without too much clutter. When it comes to drawing characters for design sheets, it is important that you keep things relatively neat to avoid any inconsistencies in the characters' design further down the line. When you begin to develop and conceptualize your character, you're free to be very rough and messy. Once things get refined and polished off, the model sheets are meant to display a more clean, formal and official version of how the character looks.

#### Purpose of Model Sheets

Model sheets are visual reference guides used in animation to ensure consistency in a character\'s appearance, proportions, and gestures across multiple artists and scenes. They provide a standardized visual style, including various angles, poses, and expressions.

Model sheets were first created in the 1930s, once animation production began to be truly developed as a pipeline for the first time. Where artists with certain specialties had specific tasks within the departments they were in. In animated 2D feature films often times the supervising animator for a character would be heavily involved in their character's design.

**Key Purposes of Model Sheets**.

- **Consistency and Standardization:**
  - Model sheets ensure all artists working on a project understand and adhere to the same character design, preventing inconsistencies in appearance and scale.
- **Visual Reference:**
  - They act as a visual blueprint, detailing the character\'s structure, proportions, attire, and even smaller elements like hands and feet.
- **Demonstrate Range:**
  - Model sheets can show a character\'s basic range of facial expressions and typical poses to reveal personality and aid in animating specific actions.
- **Character Turnarounds:**
  - Multiple views (front, side, 3/4, back) are included to show the character\'s design from every necessary angle, which is essential for 360-degree representation.
- **Guidance for Multiple Artists:**
  - In large productions with numerous artists, model sheets are critical for unifying the collective effort, making it look as though one artist created all the character art.

**What Model Sheets Include**.

- **Character Turnarounds:**
  - Drawings showing the character from different angles (front, side, back, 3/4).
- **Expression Sheets:**
  - Sketches illustrating various facial expressions and emotional reactions.
- **Pose Sheets:**
  - Examples of common stances and body language.
- **Proportion Guides:**
  - Horizontal lines are often included to help maintain consistent proportions for key features like the head and torso.
- **Design Details:**
  - Specific elements like clothing, accessories, and even color palette can be included to provide comprehensive guidance.

##### Creating a Character Model Sheet for 2D Animation

When you think of animation, your favorite Warner Brothers cartoon or classic Disney films may come to mind. There are two primary types of frame-by-frame animation used: [hand-drawn][QyBOUhguNY]and [rigged][cCRpnUIovT] animation.

**Hand Drawn**:

This animation method requires the animator to draw each frame of the animation by hand, illustrating small changes between each frame to create the illusion of movement, also known as **_Traditional_** or **_Classical Animation_**.

> [This technique][ZCNTEyzcqB]requires each frame of the character's full body (or select layers/body parts) to be redrawn, between 8 to 24 drawings per second, depending on the desired speed and smoothness of the action.

![image](./images/unnamed_1373.jpg)

> How do animated TV shows and movies keep a consistent art style with so many different animators?

Before any animator starts working there are lots and lots of model sheets created for each character that gives every single detail about how they should look and feel, so the animators know how to keep it consistent. Character Model Sheets are essential for consistency and provide a guide to artists. Ideally, producers, directors, animation directors, art directors or lead animators will work to maintain consistency in the artwork. To stay "on model" is the name of the game, and most professional, serious artists in the industry have strong draftsmanship and can capture character.

![image](./images/unnamed_1421.png)

Normally, animators are split into teams working on a particular character on 2D animated feature films. That way, an animator just has to coordinate with a small team, not every other animator on the film. Those animators are chosen for their particular strengths. Some animators are really great with animating animals, for instance. Some are better animating male characters. For each character there is a lead animator who is in charge of coordinating their team. To the trained eye, on both feature films and television shows, you can see the individual artists' styles creep in.

In TV/streaming animated series, usually animators are assigned specific scenes or sequences of scenes at a time and they need to animate everything within that scene, minus 3D props or 2D traditionally-animated FX, but otherwise, all characters within all their scenes. Sometimes on more hybrid series (that have more traditional animation in them), you'll have two teams making two separate passes on each designated scene, one team for just the key posing part of the animation and another team for in the inbetweens animation.

[**How can newbie hand drawn animation artists make their art look professional and smooth like realistic animation?**][iyYEKXehAt]

Professional traditional animators, and I mean the very good ones, started animating when they were teenagers and drawing even younger. For many artists, animators included, art is an obsession that starts early in life. By the time they've graduated high school and college, and become professionals, they already have thousands of hours of [practice][RLqhtuFUkP].

![image](./images/unnamed_073.gif)

You also have to consider that high end animation is a chain process that involves several steps. The person that draws the poses/keyframes might not be the same person that draws the in-betweens, and is not the person that cleans, inks and paints. You might be looking at one frame of animation not realizing it is the combined work of 3 or 4 artists. So there's a lot of work and technique in professional-looking animation.

What you can do is use a technique called [limited animation][WiTxQddIvL], in which you make fewer drawings per second and/or hold poses with minimal movement for lengths of time. You separate the elements of an animated character in different layers, like the body from the arms, the mouth, the eyes, and animate only the elements needed. For example, if the character is talking you want to animate the mouth and perhaps the eyes but you don't need to redraw the entire body on every frame. You can get away with drawing the body once and using that same drawing for many seconds at a time. That gives you the opportunity to draw a very good character that will stay on for a long time and save time by only animating the mouth.

![image](./images/unnamed_1107.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_379.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_702.png)

As you can see, there can be many variations of how model sheets can look.

The visual style of the production and its technical limitations will determine in what level of detail the designs have to be expanded and elaborated upon. The more [hand-drawn][OjGhefFSWa] the animation style is, then the more angles & perspectives the production will be [storyboarded][bOQNEpCzng] in. Therefore the more references you need to create for the builds and animation crew.

![image](./images/unnamed_490.jpg)

**Rigged Animation:**

This style of animation requires animators to create a [puppet rig][SIoWkchWDr] of their character. This is done by illustrating all of the characters' body parts and props on different layers and attaching them together to create joints, also known as _2D Puppet Animation_.

![image](./images/unnamed_058.png)
![image](./images/unnamed.gif)
![image](./images/unnamed_074.gif)
![image](./images/unnamed_016.gif)

All the elements and body parts are drawn digitally, piece by piece, assembled and built together as computer generated artwork that can be moved and manipulated around, just like puppetting a [rig][NmxSxtNQFP] around frame by frame.

![image](./images/unnamed_1654.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_510.jpg)

For the most part, rigged characters are meant to look, move, and feel as close to traditionally animated characters as possible, they simply have libraries of pre-designed body parts for animators to call upon, cycle through, and use and controllers to be able to puppeteer the character with virtual bones, joints, and handles to navigate the build with.

When it comes to designing for 2D animation, keeping your designs relatively simple is the best way to ensure an easy conversion to animation. However, technology and software for allowing complex designs to be still well-animated are being improved every year.

**Example of simple vs complex:**

![image](./images/unnamed_817.png)

**Example of simple vs complex:**

![image](./images/unnamed_417.png)

When possible, small details that do not add much to a character's personality should be removed during this simplification process. Sometimes the client/showrunner/art director has requirements that need to be met, so there can be lots of versions and revisions made in order to fine-tune the designs to be to everyone's liking.

👉 [Watch this clip][OHTsHQliQs] demonstrating the different types of animation and how they work.

Most 2D animated series nowadays are a hybrid between **traditional** and **rigged** animation methods. In an effort to make it look as classically hand-drawn as possible in appearance but still benefiting from the use of rigs with reusing body parts and [tweening][xbDXyXLglQ] the [animation][QnZrVBpIyr] from pose to pose, with combining the principles of [classical][sjjlJXCHGQ] traditional animation - this way it makes it appear more hand-made and less computer-generated, therefore looking more like an animated picture book or comic book, giving the characters and backgrounds more appeal and a hand-drawn / hand-painted style.

Learn more about the merging of animation styles and how different technologies are used to achieve various forms of art direction [here][pPYkfwnPQL].

Some series are completely frame-by-frame animated but still paperless and entirely 2D/digital, simply made to look and move like the old classical style, right down to the pencil graphite textured line work:

![image](./images/unnamed_014.gif)

No matter what the art style is, or the method and approach in which it will be animated, it always starts off as rough concept sketches by the designers, and it builds up from there.

Iconic legacy characters from long-lasting franchises have [evolved][egIvcKclau] a lot through the decades.

##### Creating a Character Model Sheet for 3D Animation

Creating a character model sheet for 3D/CGI animation is nearly identical to the process for 2D with only a few key differences. To help the artists who will be creating the 3D model of your character design, it is best to illustrate characters in a T-pose, displaying both the line art version and the color version as separate images. This is because the character modeler will import the design into their CGI software as a guide, so the character's outlines need to be easily visible, UV mapping and shading comes later for the coloring portion of the modeling. As you'll see from the samples below, certain details on angles and views need to be shown in more precise details, so the sculpting of the 3D model can be built more accurately.

The [T-pose][pEwGUdCYpD] is more common in designing characters for 3D animation since the modeling aspect of translating the designs into sculpted builds requires the character to have the arms stretched outwards to properly set up their [rigs][nUhvNfRLiy].

Alternatively there's the A-Pose, which means ("anatomical pose" in medical illustrations):

##### Creating a Character Model Sheet for Stop-motion Animation

Character design sheets are made in a similar way for stop-motion/claymation puppet production as well. Illustrating full turnaround views, the many expressions and mouth shapes for lip sync, and full breakdowns for rotations and costume changes.

The character sheets become reference for the model builders that must hand sculpt and fabricate the body parts, mouth shapes, expressions and clothing needed to create the puppets, including those who make CG model versions for [3D-printing][HYHvCgBITu] purposes.

> Knowing how your designs will be brought to the next stages can help inform your decisions on how better to design them - which will provide more accurate references for those artists that will be building your creations. Whether it's for 2D, 3D or [Stop Motion][hLDlEZBnug], it's important to know how your artwork will be turned into [models/builds][wzKjWGlXqC] for animators to use. For example, see how these studios created their puppets for [Pinocchio][zRXqQSDODU], [ParaNorman][OTRuTtFJXd], [Kubo][zbqdPInVAe], [Isle of Dogs][qRQAeBlSNm], [Coraline][sUnFmSUkth], and [Missing Link][VvWifVetvu].

### Research & Preparation

The start of any foray into character design begins with plenty of research and rough sketching, then more research and more sketching. Whether you're creating a character entirely on your own from imagination, or you're designing characters for someone else - you will need to start gathering and collecting info and producing material for yourself to use as a starting-off point.

👉 [Greg Broadmore][SrAOdOoPQI] talks about fighting self-doubt and getting into your flow-state.

![image](./images/unnamed_1455.png)

Oftentimes, as a character designer, you're working off of a chosen design style, this is your reference to start from, you must LEARN this style in order to create NEW characters that fit with this established look.

But other times you have to start from scratch, with an empty canvas, a blank page, the style is not created yet, and it's up to you to FIND that style. So you must discover it for yourself and you need to start somewhere...

![image](./images/unnamed_821.png)

Sometimes your client can begin with specific concepts in mind - for example, you can get a note saying _"We are looking for a Vin Vogel type of style, let's start there..."_.

It makes your job easy in the beginning, because you have a place to start. Right away, your research has a **target look**.

![image](./images/unnamed_326.png)

You search up Vin Vogel's illustrations ☝️ and his picture books, then make a few dozen sketches inspired by this imagery.

Create new rough character drawings according to your client's specs. Begin exploring and work your way towards more refined designs.

![image](./images/unnamed_1337.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1096.png)

Other times, just getting started can be more challenging - your client/director isn't sure where to begin, they can be vague and ambiguous, only knowing the age or gender or only having a short description of the personalities & backstories of the cast of characters you're meant to design. That's when YOU find some images of many different styles to present them, and ask which ones inspire them most.

Once you get those answers, then you can narrow the focus of your research and do rough sketches with a bit more direction. If they still don't have much information to give you, then you begin with a broad and wide range of styles; grab imagery online, make an image board (some call it a mood board or look board), and present it to your client. This may take several attempts to narrow down the focus of a design style that appeals to them. You don't have to start sketching anything until they point out to you which styles they find most appropriate. With the feedback you get from them, you now have a place to start.

In your [researching journey][TrhCrlWDtY] you'll discover other similar art styles that you can use as additional inspiration. For example, in this case, the looser and sketchier designs of _Fred Blunt_ might have aspects you could use:

![image](./images/unnamed_763.jpg)

After 100+ years of illustrated and animated characters to have as potential reference, there are countless styles to be inspired from. Often you'll need to borrow aspects from several ones and combine them, to develop something original and to match any descriptions given to you, but creating image boards like these can have your client begin to pick which ones they prefer most, and then you have somewhere to start.

#### Preliminary Process

It's time for information gathering - There's a few approaches to take for the research and discovery phase of your original character design. The first, which may feel the most satisfying and fun to many of us, is brainstorming (to figure out what it is you are looking for). The second is to really dive in with an intensive research and study. The third, is to create a mood board or reference sheet for yourself, this is a collection of visual themes and imagery that connects with you and the character you're trying to create (especially if you are really starting from scratch). This could mean spending some time on stock image sites like Google Images or searching through artists' portfolio sites like Art Station, DeviantArt and the big one... Pinterest (examples: [Cats][ZIpKVHAyoK] / [Horses][FZOIzeEpbL] / [Anthro Creatures][FwXITQdjGE] / [Alien Creatures][WHmfYsbHHM] / [Centaurs][zNfDkGEZpg] / [Griffins][DPGsbYFxLz] / [Chibi][SotrtQKDmX] / [Vikings][IcrhDJgptI] / [Ninjas][fBuHajirZb] / [Knights][rrMyHRYCmz] / [Pirates][YBqNXwQZEs] / [Cowboys][jXHbXZInwC] / [Robots][gLGqnQAlNY] / [Steampunk][XwXNbFvEQQ]).

> 👉 The first steps are: Thinking \>\> Researching \>\> Collecting

What style are you looking to convey? Is this for a client? Based on an existing property? Your own creation? Is there a source material like a comic book, children's picture book, novel, or game to reference? Does your producer/art director have a design style already in mind? What themes and topics will these designs have to say? What world or time period is the story set in? Put some thought into what personalities you want to [visualize][vTWDoiWDSL] and what moods & identities you want to explore. [Research][wOTEnhRbjP] can mean looking up illustrators and artists you admire and setting a framework in place to model after, or collecting a wide range of [design styles][KrqsVVZPqk] to assemble together to show the client, all to get feedback on what direction to start with. This includes searching for places, objects, and people who may provide more subtle or indirect inspiration for your work.

For example, the character Ethical Bug from the movie Puss in Boots _The Last Wish_:

![image](./images/unnamed_1537.png)

Was inspired by the character Jiminy Cricket and actor James Stewart:

![image](./images/unnamed_1281.jpg)

The character Tatischeff from the movie _The Illusionist (2010)_:

![image](./images/unnamed_1215.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_291.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1277.png)

Was directly inspired by the look and mannerisms of actor Jacques Tati:

To create this design:

**How to Find References for your Character Design.**

Example - Let's say you need to design some medieval/RPG/fantasy characters in some sort of D&D style world:

- Start where you're comfortable, with a [brainstorm][YlYujKvLAs]
- Dive deep into the subject, with an intensive [study][xkYCrITRMn]
- Whether it's analog or digital, get lost in the gathering of [inspiration][eiBNKbZIFW]

The idea is to find a wide range of styles, then narrow it down to what feels most appropriate for the character(s) you're creating.

The most memorable characters are the ones that make an impression, so getting their individual attributes and personalities correct is key, and this can take lots of experimenting and trials-and-error to get there. Think about some of your favorite characters from movies, television, internet and literature --- they all started as an idea, perhaps partially based off of a real person the author/creator knew, and was then developed and visualized with careful intention and hard work.

![image](./images/unnamed_731.jpg)

For Costume Design - there can be many aspects to explore, experiment with shapes, patterns, colors, and a variety of styles:

![image](./images/unnamed_019.gif)
![image](./images/unnamed_1034.png)

For most human-like characters \> researching hairstyles, body shapes and clothing options are all part of the [process][ZwfKzWTODV].

**How a Character's Choice of Clothing Benefits the Story.**

When writing or designing a character, it's important that everything you include serves a purpose. The character's name, their favorite color, and their choice of companion give an impression about the character, the world around them, and the past that shaped who they are. The more you amplify these elements, the greater the image you're painting for the reader and to the viewer.

For example, say the plot calls for the character to buy a car, and they choose a blue one. "Blue" is a necessary detail to include in the narrative, but by giving this specific decision meaning, you make it important. Perhaps blue was their parent's favorite color, and they strive to please them. Perhaps blue is a calming color, and it reflects their calm personality. This makes the narrative richer.

![image](./images/unnamed_1150.jpg)

In the same way that characters have ways to emote and show their feelings with their faces and body language, characters also need clothing (at least most of them do), so why not make it a useful element in the story? Take advantage of this opportunity to tell the reader something. Here are three things showing how your character's choice of clothing can be used to amplify the story.

1. **It Says Something About Their Personality:** The way a character dresses can reflect their tastes, views, and emotions. For example, your boisterous character might be best dressed in colorful shorty shorts to reflect her free spirit. Her sass and disregard for other's opinions is what tells us her personality, but this small addition has made the fact visual as well as mental. In another case, your reserved and slightly distrustful character might be better dressed in a bulky designer coat; this reflects on his desire to be enclosed but also regarded as superior. Your character's personality is independent, but the proper clothing can complement and amplify their unique views.
2. **It Says Something About The Setting:** Dressing your characters in clothing that reflects their setting will reinforce this new atmosphere in the reader's mind. Colors give impressions all on their own; dark colors such as greys or blacks will match the dark atmospheres. If you're trying to show a contrast between two groups - one more successful and the other starving - dressing one group in bright pinks or yellows will give a sense of light and energy, making them seem healthier. The style also reflects the world; conservative dress such as long sleeves or coats can reflect order or oppression, while less conservative clothing can show rebellion and freedom. Your world itself will determine the setting, but clothing can complement it, amplifying the atmosphere.
3. **It Can Say Something About Them Physically:** In addition to symbolism, clothing can serve a literal purpose. If you have a young character, dressing them in outfits which are colorful and airy can complement their younger attitudes. If you have a character with an embarrassing scar or injury they wish to hide, constantly dressing them in long sleeves, despite weather, can subtly reveal this. These details can amplify the characters themselves but also open new doors for foreshadowing.

Every detail included in your design should serve a purpose, and perhaps even tell a story within a story. Seemingly minor aspects such as a character's style of clothes and hair, or the choice of colors in their outfits, can breathe new life into the details of your narrative.

![image](./images/unnamed_1082.png)

**Build Your Visual Library:**

Seek out and collect reference material everywhere you can.

To begin - explore the various [avenues online][jQvSmoQruz] to get your creativity sparked and ready to go.

Collect sites with resources on character development, sift through archives of design packs, and have them saved and ready at your fingertips for quick reference. And most of all, seek out tips and [advice][BSJdsGiCwJ] on style and technique, and always search out daily [inspiration][VnHDjhGxvh].

![image](./images/unnamed_1438.jpg)

An option to explore sometimes is to create a mood board (inspiration boards / reference boards). These are the perfect place to work out what the foundation of your design style could be. Knowing basic details about your characters will help you create references for your image board throughout the writing or drawing process - and will keep you focused in the direction you need to go towards for creating believable characters.

![image](./images/unnamed_014.png)

**Backstory.**

If possible - as part of your initial brainstorming session, create the character's [backstory][DebNvFpwXS], it doesn't have to be super detailed. If someone else created the character, then find out what their backstory is by asking them (the writer/creator/director) of the production. But if you are creating this character entirely on your own, then start with a few words or short sentences. Write a summary of their personality traits and history, it can be point form, with a list of traits, or write a short blurb about who they are. This can be a simple chart about who this character is and try to capture their key essence. What kind of character do you want to bring to life? What kind of character do you need to tell your particular story?

![image](./images/unnamed_566.jpg)

_Some questions you want to ask yourself are:_

- How old are they?
- Where are they from?
- What do they like?
- Are they shy, fierce, serious, goofy?
- What do they sound like?
- What do they do in their free time?
- What kind of music do they listen to?
- What does this person's day look like?

The answers to these questions can change also, just as the character's appearance will evolve before the time comes that the final design is done and approved, so too can the character's personality. Whether this is a character entirely of your own creation, or from the mind of your client/boss - either way, answering these sorts of questions will help inform your decisions in how to [visualize your character][YsIBbokRoV].

![image](./images/unnamed_1425.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_292.jpg)

The character's backstory will give us ideas of what makes them unique and what kind of wardrobe/accessories they could have. This will also make the development for poses and attitude drawings flow more naturally and convincingly later on. Asking these kinds of questions before you start researching and designing allows for a better understanding of your character and their personality/history. It's also possible that all you'll have to go by is a written paragraph describing the character, or maybe even a brief conversation with the creator.

When reading a script you are using for the information found in it to help you gain insight on your character's personality. To get you started, you will be searching for characterizations and clues to their disposition and attitude. What is an example of [characterization][tHvVEpCUSj]? Direct characterization tells the script reader about the character - what they look like, their personality traits, what they like, what they dislike, and their appearance. For example, an author may write: \"Charlotte was a frizzy-haired bookworm.\" In just a few words we have a hint of their personality and physical attributes.

Characterisation by definition: The making of a character by constructing a description of the distinctive nature or features of someone or something.

Visual characterization is the process through which an artist communicates a character's appearance to an audience. In writing, characterization is achieved through dialogue, actions, and descriptions - In animation, illustration, video games, it is achieved through the character's design and physical representation.

> Remember, if you are **creating** a character, you are also helping to develop their personality, and by doing so, you essentially become a [writer][YftTjcNPjA].

1. **You start with the personality.** Once that's done it's relatively easier to know what they look like. You sculpt and pick virtues and vices, flaws and qualities --- **perfect characters are not interesting**. When it comes to protagonists and antagonists, they're neither 100% good nor 100% bad, because there are not fully good or bad people. Get what I'm saying? Round characters are the thing we're going for. **Take details from people in real life, if you want:** funny habits, mannerisms, what makes people _human_.
2. **Work on the appearance of your character.** What's their body type, their eye color, skin color, hair color, shape of their face/nose, if they have birthmarks or scars somewhere.
3. **Pick a name as you see fit.** This can be the first step depending on how you work. Is there a meaning behind it? Does it somehow show their character's personality? Remember sometimes they are relevant to the setting/genre.
4. **Flesh. 'Em. Out.** Think of hobbies and background/history. How's the relationship with their family and friends, how they act around authority, what kinds of clothes they like to wear...
5. **Always remember:** character development is an ongoing thing. You never "finish" [developing your character][wwbWLLqEPp], just like we, as people, don't stay the same.

Focus on Authenticity

- **Realistic Personality:** Give your character a unique personality with likes, dislikes, quirks, and firm opinions, rather than a generic\"wise and courageous heroine\" archetype.
- **Believable Backstory:** Provide a backstory, even if tragic, that actually explains the character\'s current state and motivations, rather than being a generic detail.
- **Avoid Self-Inserts:** Don\'t create a character that is a thinly veiled version of yourself. Instead, aim for multi-dimensional characters with both virtues and vices.

![image](./images/unnamed_1027.png)

**The 3 Categories:**

- **Primary Characters -** The main characters of the story, seen the most often on-screen, they drive the plot forward, we follow them on their journey, we see the narrative through their point of view, the show is about them or revolves around their actions.
- **Secondary Characters -** The supporting cast, seen less often, recurring characters in the story, sometimes they can have as much dialogue or screen-presence as the main characters, but they play a supporting role to the primary cast.
- **Incidental Characters -** Background characters, the focus is rarely on them, these could be pedestrians walking in the distance, random civilians populating the scenery, and citizens in crowds or scattered around in the backdrop of the scene. In live-action, these are referred to as Extras.

_Example of incidental characters from various design styles:_

**The 4 main types of characters:**

1. **Static characters** are characters who never change during a story.
2. **Dynamic characters** are characters who go through an inner change within a story.
3. **Flat characters** are underdeveloped, one-dimensional characters without a layered backstory, no motivations, or internal conflicts.
4. **Round characters** are characters with well-developed strengths, weaknesses, goals, and relatable flaws.

A \"character arc\" is the transformation or inner journey a character undergoes throughout a story, where they start as one type of person and gradually change into a different version of themselves due to the events and challenges they face within the narrative. Not all characters will have an arc.

**Static vs. Dynamic is a different dichotomy than Round vs. Flat:**

- _Static vs. dynamic_ refers to whether or not a character changed and evolved throughout the story.
- _Round vs. flat_ refers to whether or not a character has depth and layered characteristics.

Starting off with these foundations can help you distinguish your character development and properly balance their stories in more satisfying ways. From here, you branch out into other categories, like choosing their archetype...

**Archetypes for Memorable Characters:**

1. **The Hero or Warrior:** A brave and confident character who is working to help a cause. Heroes are typically the main character and you will see a lot of square shape language in their designs. This archetype is perfect for characters that stand out and really care about protecting others. An alternative would also be the Everyman, this archetype is ideal for helping the reader or audience see themselves in the story. These types of characters are ordinary people, often thrown into extraordinary circumstances. These protagonists don\'t need to have any special talents and are often reluctant to continue their journey, even though it\'s usually the right thing to do. They are often Humble, Sympathetic, Overwhelmed, Quietly Courageous.
   - ![Example of the Hero Character Archetype](./images/unnamed_1243.jpg)
   - _The Incredibles_ (2004)
2. **The Rebel or Outlaw:** A character who is talented but who may not work for any cause or dislikes authority figures. This type of character is often known as an anti-hero, the anti-hero, a character who lacks traditional characteristics that are associated with a conventional hero. While typically guided by the best of intentions, the anti-hero is a classically flawed character with a history of bad decisions and a questionable moral code. They still really stand out but can often be more morally gray than your typical hero/protagonist. You will see a lot more triangular shape language used in this archetype. The [fallen hero][OEkXGkDTCe] or the [anti-villain][GVSsegZIPP] are also options to explore, while the classic are more of the conventional villain.
   - ![Example of the Outlaw Character Archetype](./images/unnamed_286.jpg)
   - _Megamind_ (2010)
3. **The Explorer:** These characters are rugged, free-spirited, and always looking to discover new things. Confident, smug, adventurer. Explorers are typically a combination of square and triangle shape language, providing them with a lot of interesting design possibilities!
   - ![Example of the Caregiver Character Archetype](./images/unnamed_1481.jpg)
   - _Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas_ (2003)
4. **The Creator or The Innocent:** An inventive and creative character - often nerdy and introverted. This character style will typically have a combination of curves and angular shape language. It is also common for creators to have an exaggerated, large head size to communicate their intellectuality. Traits - Driven, Asocial, Fixated, Perfectionist. An alternative in this category is The Orphan, another widely used archetype that\'s fairly easy to spot. **The Orphan** doesn\'t have to be a child, although it\'s common that they are. This character type doesn\'t even have to lose his or her parents to be an Orphan in this sense. Sometimes Orphans have abusive or absentee parents and are looking for the "family" that they can be happy with.
   - ![Example of the Creator Character Archetype](./images/unnamed_1460.jpg)
   - _Meet the Robinsons_ (2007)
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_876.png)
   - _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_ (2022)
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_086.png)
   - _Up_ (2009)
5. **The Ruler:** A leader character who is focused on maintaining order. This archetype usually depicts a controlling character with very strong features. Shape language for these characters can vary, however, square shape language is always a solid foundation. An alternative is also, **The Leader**, they are a well-known archetype that often mixes well with others, such as the Hero and the Warrior. The Leader has a goal and a plan to get there, which makes for conflict when something happens to derail the character from his or her goal. Leaders have the ability to inspire action in others. Since power attracts all types, the Leader can come as a hero or a villain.
   - ![Example of the Ruler Character Archetype](./images/unnamed_1372.jpg)
   - _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_ (2018)
6. **The Magician:** An eccentric character who is able to create/wield magic. You can have a lot of fun with exaggeration in these characters - their shapes are typically angular and whimsical.
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_358.png)
   - _Sword in the Stone_ (1963)
7. **The Caregiver:** A caring character who has a soft, comforting appearance. Caregiver designs use primarily circular shapes, giving them a wholesome, huggable aesthetic. These traits make them a typically cute character type.
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_176.png)
   - _Big Hero 6_ (2014)
8. **The Jester:** A [comic relief][rMLFWFFEML] character with a quirky often endearing appearance. This is another archetype where you can experiment with exaggeration! Jester's design will often veer away from the confines of the ideal beauty standard in a way that can be both comical and comforting. As an alternative, this can also be The Trickster or The Sidekick, always a staunch ally, supporting sidekick characters come in all shapes and sizes. You\'ve seen them as robots, humans, pet animals, and supernatural creatures. Helpful, Devoted, Humorous, Loyal (sometimes to a fault). Examples - Ron Weasely from _Harry Potter_, R2D2 from _Star Wars_, Tinker Bell from _Peter Pan_. Olaf from _Frozen_, Timon & Pumbaa from _The Lion King_, Patrick from _Spongebob_.
   - ![Example of the Jester Character Archetype](./images/unnamed_580.jpg)
   - _Lilo & Stitch_ (2002)
9. **The Lover:** A character who is devoted to what they love. There is no right way to depict the lover, as different characters will be attracted to different appearances. However, if you are stuck, using features that are usually associated with society's beauty ideals can be a good place to start.
   - ![Example of the Lover Character Archetype](./images/unnamed_1233.jpg)
   - _Enchanted_ (2007)
10. **The Sage or Mentor:** Also known as The Herald, a character who guides other characters -- typically portrayed as old and wise, perhaps monk or wizard-like. This character could be merged with The Magician as well. This archetype often has a combination of circular and angular shape language.
    - ![Example of the Sage or Harold Character Archetype](./images/unnamed_1465.jpg)
    - _Kung Fu Panda_ (2008)
    - ![image](./images/unnamed_678.png)
    - _Clone Wars_ (2008)

There are many other sub categories as well, like **The Character Foil**, a character who contrasts another, usually the Protagonist, in order to highlight his/her traits.

![image](./images/unnamed_075.png)

_The Lord of the Rings_ (2001)

Once you are aware of these [archetypes][znfcoUUqAW] you will be armed with more ammunition to create designs that will clearly communicate your character's personality. If none of these categories feel quite right for your character, you can always combine multiple tropes or motifs, or subvert them completely to create a more unique design!

![image](./images/unnamed_438.png)

Trends in storytelling and character development for archetypes have evolved over time. There are many other classes to explore and choose from, see [here][UUlTrEnLAC] for more lists, and [here][YxSmfZHpfq] for more stock character archetypes.

Other classifications that often overlap many of the identities outlined above are **The Protagonist** and **The Antagonist**, these are usually the two central characters of a story. A protagonist is the main point-of-view character, while the antagonist is the opposing force who stands in the way of the protagonist\'s goals. The protagonist is often the hero of the story, while the antagonist is usually the villain. These are usually tied to one or several types of [conflict][LBMgfAaapS] found within the core of the story.

![image](./images/unnamed_1059.jpg)

On a deeper level, you must always ask yourself - what does your character represent within the story and world that is being shown? Are they symbolizing a thing or abstraction as a person? For example - Personification allegory is a type of allegory in which a fictional character represents a concept or a type. Symbolic allegory is one in which a character or material thing is not merely a transparent vehicle for an idea. Often these concepts are not for the designer to decide upon, but rather they should have these concepts described to them, to help in the discovery process of visualizing the character. If you are the creator of this story and the world they live in, or helping to develop it with others, then these are factors you may want to consider - since it could affect the look of your character design.

A classic example of a personification allegory is the character \"Everyman\" from the medieval play of the same name, where \"Everyman\" represents the universal human experience and embodies concepts like mortality, virtue, and sin, essentially giving human qualities to an abstract idea like \"the average person.\" In symbolic allegory, the characters have an autonomous narrative outside of the messages they convey. The character Virgil in Dante\'s Divine Comedy, from 1320, is a symbolic allegorical figure because he represents both the historical author of the Aeneid and the human faculty of reason.

**The Art of Personification.**

It was long common in the visual arts to use human figures to represent a range of natural phenomena, personal qualities, abstract conceptions, and so on. The ancient Greeks and Romans have literature and mythologies depicting these; many of their gods and goddesses represented their own single things, be it _Dawn_ (Eos, Aurora), _Wisdom_ (Athena, Minerva), or _War_ (Ares, Mars). In Roman mythology, Justitia was one of the four Virtues, she was often portrayed as a stately woman, blindfolded, holding scales and a sword, each became a personification of that phenomenon or quality or concept, in this case, Justice. Inspired by classical art, Renaissance painters and sculptors likewise began producing thousands of artistic personifications \-- _Time_, or _Folly_, or _France_, or _Vice_, or _Poetry_, or the _Americas_. And in the 18th century English-speakers began using the word itself. Today artists are less inclined to such depictions, and the word gets used more often to describe actual individuals; when we call someone the personification of style, or greed, or loyalty, we mean the ideal or epitome and embodiment of that quality.

![image](./images/unnamed_1403.jpg)

**Who is the Demographic?**

When you design a character, it is important to know who your audience is. For example, a design that appeals to young children may not always appeal to adults. So before you start your design, take a moment to think about your audience (and the target demographic of the production they're in. How old are they? Are they aimed at any gender in particular? Answering these questions will allow you to cater your designs more toward your audience and therefore ensure your character is more engaging for them, making the property more successful.

_The Main Categories:_

- Preschool (3-5)
- Bridge (5-7)
- Kids (6-11)
- Co-viewing/Teen
- Adults

Another way to classify the audience age groups is with the [rating system][iTUjWOgzjU] found in media and video game guidelines:

![image](./images/unnamed_962.png)

**What is the Genre?**

The world and story your characters will be placed in will directly affect the style they will be visualized in, the environments will influence the look of your final character designs and their look will also influence the design style of the world they're in. A dark animated horror film for adults will have a very different aesthetic to the design work compared to a whimsical adventure series for preschool kids. For example, here's a the main genres:

**Comedy, Action, Drama, Fantasy, Thriller, Adventure, Mystery, Science Fiction, Musical, Educational.**

There are several sub-genres as well, and you can mix these up too, most series and films are categorized with at least two combined.

- **Rick and Morty** is considered to be Science-Fiction / Action / Comedy (and even Dark Comedy)
- **Over the Garden Wall** could be known as Fantasy with brief elements of Horror / Comedy / Musical / Drama
- **Gravity Falls** is seen as Adventure / Mystery / Comedy
- **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles** is described as Action / Adventure
- **Bluey** is known for being an Educational / Comedy
- **The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy** is a Supernatural / Comedy / Slapstick / Surreal Humor

Defining these isn't too important (and not usually your job as the designer), just be aware that knowing the Genre and Demographic can give you an idea of what the art direction might look like. Sometimes you dive into it and you accidentally discover what's most appropriate for the character, and this can influence or change the intended personality and art direction as well. Your client or director should be the one to provide you with this sort of information. If you are working alone and creating the character entirely yourself, then determining what the Genre and Demographic is for this world and its characters can help to get you started on the look of your characters. If you only have to go off of a script or text descriptions, then re-read it often, to get as much info and inspiration from it as you can.

Sometimes subverting the look of the character designs is the goal as well; like the series _Drawn Together_, purposefully mixed various styles, but was a series made for a mature/adult audience. _Gumball_, mixes styles too, and it's made for kids 6-11, however _Smiling Friends_ mixes styles in a similar way but is intended more for teens & adult audiences. Some terms and examples of mixing styles together are on display [here][iVGIYAygXi].

![image](./images/unnamed_254.png)

#### Inspiration

Research more and more, explore lots of options, discover new and different artists, saving collections of examples of the potential styles you may need to refer to later. Doing this makes certain you've considered all your possibilities before starting another round of rough drawings. There's thousands of character art styles out there, it's easy to be overwhelmed, begin your searches as broad explorations, then refine it down to the ones that you feel fit best with what you're doing and what you're looking for.

![image](./images/unnamed_1147.png)

Narrow down your search to what the world/story your characters are set in, and focus on what their personalities may be. If you're working with a client or director, gather as much information as you can from them, to determine what parameters or limitations or pre-established art style they may have in mind to draw [inspiration][RzOqpotyYF] from. Seek out, find, build, gather information & references for you to use as a springboard for your [rough][sqjIbePqVb] exploration sketches.

![image](./images/unnamed_580.png)

> The goal is to organize all of your inspiration in one place so that you can reference it as you work.

Become influenced and excited by artists on Instagram, Deviant Art, Tumblr, Art Station and Pinterest - Examples like the art style of [Jin Kim][ClxeHtEzxe], [Glean Keane][OXDDBEEelw], [Jamie Hewlett][PHfoHxpAbK], or anyone that you find inspiring. Looking at the amazing works of your favorite artists can really help improve your creativity and give you new techniques and ideas to try in your own work. If you got a glimpse of a show you liked, you can always go on [IMDB][mkWzzHFvJV] and skim through the _full cast & crew_ section of the name of that show or movie, this way you can find who the designers were, then you can find their portfolios online.

Remember, inspiration can be found in a million different places. An old song, a news article, a documentary, the logo from a sign on a downtown storefront, and from books... like this illustration, taken from _The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin_, became inspiration for the animated film [The Thief and The Cobbler][WtFYDFOeNc]:

![image](./images/unnamed_1202.png)

When diving into the researching process, think about how to find some images for attitudes, hairstyles, costumes and ideas on portraying your characters physically. Look around for any design inspiration you can find. The deeper you dig, the more you can find imagery that can influence your choices in the right direction. Let's say you're required to design a _group of pretentious high school girls..._

Research and reference real people & photo references for the types of personalities, ethnicities and clothing/hair styles you are exploring for your characters:

Rough Exploration Sketches by Brittany Meyers

Think like you are casting for a movie. Look at real people or photos and take notes on what makes that person them. Everyone is different - they have their own stories, tastes, habits, body shapes, and attitudes.

Everyone has different charms in their own way, and paying attention and capturing these details in your characters will make them feel genuine and unique.

Finding references can help to push your style and characters into all sorts of different directions, often times a happy accident occurs when sketching and exploring a wide range of personalities:

#### Thumbnails

Planning is a critical stage in the [process][QPdVZcMKgW]. You'd be surprised how important it is to really think through and plan your designs before you get started. It's extremely important and helps you avoid problems that could show up later, and also discover things that can really enhance and bring out the best in your potential designs.

**Thumbnails** is a term used in many areas, like roughing out poses for animation:

![image](./images/unnamed_053.gif)

The quick and loose preliminary sketches in storyboards:

![image](./images/unnamed_1036.png)

And those tiny title card images you see on YouTube or Netflix:

![image](./images/unnamed_1466.png)

In Character Design, thumbnails are all the small rough sketches made to hash out your ideas.

While you are collecting references and preparing the info you need, you will begin to have an idea of what you want this character to represent. Start making lots of thumbnails by sketching the character(s) you have in mind, but keep your sketches very loose and [rough][QsuAHGIEzy] at this stage.

![image](./images/unnamed_815.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_099.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1409.jpg)

Make LOTS of sketches! \-- This can be the most fun part of the process...

**'Roughs'** can mean different things to different artists. For example, animation director Glen Keane is known for drawing VERY rough:

![image](./images/unnamed_403.png)

Other artists prefer to draw their roughs much cleaner:

![image](./images/unnamed_800.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1473.jpg)

Just like your handwriting, everyone has their own unique personal style of sketching.

![image](./images/unnamed_942.jpg)

Doing random doodles can sometimes lead to happy accidents and discoveries.

**Rough Drawings** tend to be not as rough as Thumbnails, but are not Clean/Final Lines either. It's always your personal preference for how rough you want to be, everyone has their own style on how they produce 'roughs', there's no right or wrong method, whatever you feel most comfortable with. Many artists/directors have varying opinions on this, but it doesn't matter too much anyways, as long as the IDEAS are clear and presentable. Producers and art directors all have their own preferences for how many stages to take between thumbnails/concept to clean+color, and how rough or final they'd like to see designs delivered and presented as. Simply go with their requests and adjust accordingly.

![image](./images/unnamed_1380.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_397.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1292.png)

- **Thumbnails** are VERY loose and sketchy, it's lines and shapes that are searching for something.
- **Roughs** have most of the details and structure present, they also look fast & scratchy, but all the shapes and volumes are in there.
- **Tie-downs** are cleaner than roughs, they're almost final lines but not quite, all the details are there.
- **Clean-up/Line art** has all the final lines laid down, the lines are refined to the weight and style needed.

![image](./images/unnamed_179.jpg)

You can say there's no difference in the volume of these two circles (shown below) and you wouldn't be wrong. The one on the right is two-dimensional and so is the one on the left. What is important is what you do not see --- the thought process behind the lines---that helps you to create more dimensional sketches with flow to them.

![image](./images/unnamed_492.png)

Don't get caught up with the details in the beginning; this is the moment to play with proportions and shapes and see what feels right for the character. Try to come up with a lot of variety at this stage.

![image](./images/unnamed_596.png)

Always start off very loose and rough, then draw over your own work, over and over to refine and shape the character. [Sketching][nozsJTPJtB] is NOT about⁠ refinement. The darker lines show your "decision lines" and the lighter "searching lines" become less important. ⁠

![image](./images/unnamed_823.png)

By [Griz & Norm][fWKsbrhoOU]

**Quantity will find quality:** When starting a sketch, be sure to draw quickly and confidently. Gloss over mistakes and don't spend too much time erasing. If you're not happy with the way your drawing is going, just start a new layer to build something fresh or iterate again. Through this process, something will eventually click and you'll know when things feel right. A lot of the time you may not know what you want to draw until it's directly in front of your eyeballs.

![image](./images/unnamed_1685.png)

For example, the story about the **pottery teacher** is a parable about the importance of quantity over quality when learning something new. The original version was told by photographer Jerry Uelsmann to motivate his _Introduction to Photography_ students at the University of Florida. The story was later retold in the book _Art & Fear_ by David Bayles and Ted Orland, while the art medium changed from photography to ceramics.

In the story, a pottery teacher splits his class into two groups and gives each group a different assignment...

Group A: Make one pot per day for 30 days

Group B: Work on only one pot for the entire 30 days

At the end of the month, the teacher judges the quality of the pots and finds that the highest quality pots came from Group A, the group that made 30 pots quickly. The teacher explains that by focusing on quantity, the students were able to learn from their mistakes and steadily improve their skills. They made 29 pots, one at a time, learning from their faults and missteps, they had to work fast, having to complete one per day, and by the last pot, #30, they had refined their process to create a well-made pot. The students in Group B, on the other hand, became paralyzed by perfection and were left with little to show for their efforts, even though they had a whole 30 days to perfect the one attempt at a single pot.

The moral of the story is that **quantity leads to quality**, and that it\'s better to create and improve over time than to focus solely on perfect quality from the start.

There are several ways to do thumbnailing, but it is always meant to be a way to jot down lots of [small ideas][DAVVOdKjZq] as a visual rehearsal. They can also be just blocks and blobs and simple silhouettes, or quick gesture drawings made of squiggly lines, or just various shapes and forms to see what works and what doesn't work.

Keep spending time researching and discovering plenty of imagery to inspire you, go online, find the types of design aesthetics, costumes, and environment that your character will be in. Compile lots of references, then start by roughing out some concepts of what the character should look like, explore and experiment with loose & quick sketches. All of this will help you to learn in a more [tactical way][dvUmEtqwUQ]. A well-researched character will have a lot more credibility and really resonate with their audience. When you are finished researching, you should have enough reference material to start designing your character.

Digital sketching is a low-stake scenario, so try not to stress too much about drawing. It's okay to make mistakes in the beginning. Embrace it and try not to worry about the details. The main goal when doing initial rough sketches is to jot down your wild ideas and then build upon them afterwards. It can look like senseless blobs, but as long as it makes sense to you, you're doing the right thing.

![image](./images/unnamed_371.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_088.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_902.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_190.jpg)

**Once you've created lots of thumbnails:**

- Revisit your most successful sketches and refine them further
- Pull together the most compelling visual elements into a definitive design

After all this sketching, ideally you create something that you want to push further. At this point you can create a new layer in your drawing program, while also lowering the _opacity_ of the previous one, so you can easily draw on top of it. It's important to stay loose and to not stiffen up when starting a "cleaner" drawing. Strengthen the design and the shapes you already put forth. In the past I often strayed too far from the sketch and became unhappy with the drawing. You chose to move forward with your sketch for a reason, so don't disregard it too much when fleshing it out.

#### Shape Language

There are three basic shapes in your toolbelt: round, box, and triangle. If you follow your intuition, each shape conveys a personality. For example:

- **Round** = charismatic, harmless, endearing, friendly, soft, cute, innocent (circles, ovals, eggs, beans)
- **Box** = reliable, uniform, traditional, stable, balanced - (squares, rectangles)
- **Triangle** = movement, harmony, cunning, dynamic, competent (downward pointing more aggressive or villainous)

![image](./images/unnamed_229.png)

- Shapes can also be **combined** for more complex characters

![image](./images/unnamed_1362.png)

There's a variety of other combinations/variations like diamond-shaped, tear-drop-shaped, oval/egg-shaped, hourglass-shaped, and bean-shaped.

![image](./images/unnamed_367.png)

When we deconstruct visual images, most objects will break down into one or more familiar shapes, each carrying their own visual signposts. See how the characters from **_Pixar's Up_** can be visually broken down to [basic shapes][bLrilynTnz].

As you can see from the images above, it can help to think of the human body as a series of relatively [simple shapes][OIGzLwsTlD] when you are starting your design.

Squares and rectangles are reliable, rigid and sturdy, possibly stubborn/unchanging too. Visually they're used to symbolize order and robustness. Think of a robot or a heavyset man, which are often represented by rectangles in [caricature][SzLVxbqTsF], and note the correlation of sturdiness to each one.

Circles (and ovals, ellipses, egg-shape) are friendly, harmless and fun. Due to the continuous nature of the line in a circle, they also represent progress and synergy. Animated characters made up of the circular look are generally protagonists, though sometimes bumbling or innocuous ones at that. Think about the Powerpuff Girls, Homer Simpson and Santa. Babies, teddy bears, dopey types and jolly characters all fall under this category of cuddly, friendly circular fun.

Triangles are dynamic shapes, indicating both balance and energy. Down-pointing triangles are used in character design for fit, active characters: think of the V-shaped chest of an athletic character, or the classic hourglass figure of a femme fatale which is largely a series of triangles stacked on top of one another.

Shapes are unlimited; it simply comes down to the most important ingredient in design, which is its organization. Break your human character shapes into three parts: head, full torso, and legs.

Head shapes of various sorts can immediately create a distinct personality for your character:

Shapes can contrast and compliment each other, while having shapes within shapes to balance each other as well:

Look at the many different shape combinations used here:

![image](./images/unnamed_958.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_900.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_314.png)

The shapes that make up the character can symbolize what they represent or give hints as to their personality, background and alignment. Combining shapes together will have their own visual significance depending on their arrangement. A rectangle and triangle together can make a house or an arrow, just as a character design with a rectangular body and circular head could be a dimwitted lackey (large rectangle, small circle) or a mega-mind genius (thin rectangle, large circle). Of course, you can always flip the tables to play with expectations. Maybe the small circular little girl is the powerful dynamo, or the stocky square guy turns out to be unstable and hyperactive.

### Exploration Sketches

A character designer is the artist responsible for conceptualizing and designing all of the characters in an animated production. Sometimes you are given a predetermined style to follow, and therefore very little reference searching is required of you. Other times, a lengthy process of exploration studies at the very beginning is made to discover what the style should be. This specific branch of the design team focuses on using comprehension of design language as well as their considerable draftsmanship skills to create new characters based upon the stories and descriptions provided to you.

> See [**this solid advice**][XiVIdVlSuS] from Don Corgi for strategies on design and color.

When you first try to experiment with what your character might look like, produce some rough drawings that allow you to rehearse, explore and discover a variety of shapes, sizes, and proportions to see what feels best. This stage is often referred to as Concept Design or Predesign.

![image](./images/unnamed_473.png)

Character Development or Visual Development (**VisDev**) is what many artists and producers will also call these stages.

In the **writing** stages; Character development is the process of creating and evolving the personalities, motivations, goals, and emotions of your animated characters. It involves defining their traits, flaws, strengths, weaknesses, relationships, and arcs.

The designers do their best to visualize these concepts, materializing them into a character.

This is one of the most creative parts of the entire production process.

![image](./images/unnamed_595.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1104.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1186.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_1242.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_347.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1024.png)

These initial **research drawing andrough sketching** stages are all about the visual character development process. Creating and evolving the look of your animated characters, first through research than LOTS of sketches. It involves defining their shape language and visualizing their personality, from the lead characters to supporting cast. All with the purpose to drive the narrative and engage the audience on an emotional level. A well-designed character possesses a strong visual aesthetic that instantly captivates the eye. This is not easy to achieve, but through lots of practice, you'll get better and better at nailing it down sooner and sooner.

Reference. Reference. Reference.

![image](./images/unnamed_1454.png)

You'll see and hear about **character development** - which can be a broad term, often you are not only trying to figure out what the characters look like, but also WHO they are and what their personalities are. As you construct their design it is easy to see how much the personality description and writings obviously influence the evolution of their design, but then the designs can also have an affect on their personality as well.

Similar to how a television actor is influenced by the writings in the scripts they read, what their character does, how they do the things they do, and what they are told to say as dialogue, all shape what the character they are meant to portray. The actor studies the written material, has discussions with writers, directors, producers about performance choices. But the actor themself adds and subtracts their own opinions and qualities to the behaviours, mannerisms and quirks that the character has. Inevitably evolving the character persona into something different than what the original intentions might have been.

These preliminary sketches can be referred to as the **Concept** stages of the characters' visual development. Where several variations and iterations of the characters are drawn up, assembled together so you and others can compare them against each other, sometimes you mix and match and swap out traits and body parts to assemble pieces together from various designs to see what might work. Usually these can be very rough to start with, all made to visually explore and see what feels best.

> ☝️ "You need to be smart with where you spend time. If you focus on detailing everything, things can become overly cluttered quickly. You can see that this elephant warrior has a lot of implied details. The lines on the elephant's core wrap around its form. Although this is rather simplistic, it gives you a good idea of what the armor can look like with just a few strokes of the pen. There are also scribbles on the deltoid armor pieces and in the elbows, implying some kind of sigil or crest. All of these "details" are conveyed with minimal work." -Erik Ly

The more art books on animated TV & media production you'll see, the more you'll notice there can be many, many versions of your character that need to be [explored][JxbqaZsQIc]. Sometimes, by chance, you nail it on the first few tries, other times, you need to revise your work several times, only to realize you need to start from scratch with a whole new approach.

Explorations sketches, conceptual sketches, thumbnailing, blocking out, vis dev, shape design exploration - it can have many names, but it's all the same approach; loose, rough, experimental and a visual rehearsal to see what works best. It's fast, it's messy, and some artists naturally draw with cleaner lines, others like [Glen Keane][tGAdPLgqNo], can be notoriously very rough - no matter what the style, this stage is meant to be all about developing the look of your character.

As you can see from all these examples, this stage of visual development for character concepts is all about trying out lots of different things, to see what looks good, and what works best for the character's function and personality and the story/themes being portrayed. Sometimes color concepts are asked for as well to be mixed in with the roughs, especially when there's one being fine-tuned to be the final possible design.

These sketches can explore variations of the same design with color concepts included to provide some options and clearer representation of how the character would look, colors are easy to replace later, they're not meant to be final quite yet, just a way to see the tones and how they could possibly work.

Proportions can be explored to almost-endless amounts of variations:

![image](./images/unnamed_738.jpg)

Roughing out exploration sketches like these will help you to discover what style you (or your client / director / producer) may be looking for, and allows you to figure out how the anatomy and mechanics of your character may work. In addition, you figure out the strengths and weaknesses in the design, see what the patterns are in the nuts and bolts of the design and what makes it work.

Exploration sketches allow you to create many versions of the character too, so that you (or your supervisor/client) can narrow down some options to arrive at the ideal solutions and get closer to the look you're all searching for.

Watch [this video][dVhSBRkjpW] that has him explaining his process.

Observe the early exploration sketches made for the character _Dash_ from "_The Incredibles_". They experimented with various graphic shapes to find the right look and personality:

![image](./images/unnamed_1244.png)

See how shape design was implemented in their character sketches early on in this film's visual development process[here][uiZuoCmAJY].

See [here][sjLEzEyFPL] for samples of exploration drawings, silhouette studies and thumbnails by Fabricio Oliveira, going from concept art to breakdowns and full color with character sheets.

See more samples [here][JkCUzqNanC], showing the design process for a cast of characters, as various options are explored and presented.

![image](./images/unnamed_1348.jpg)

Here's exploration sketches for a cast of characters made by Design Master, [Margaux Zinnser][rGnKdiHiMB].

First some basic body shapes are explored:

![image](./images/unnamed_622.jpg)

Then a variety of designs are experimented with.

This was for the Mum:

![image](./images/unnamed_1106.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_865.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_778.jpg)

After all these variations for hair and outfits were explored, choices are made and the design is finalized:

And other incidental characters:

![image](./images/unnamed_1351.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_723.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_090.jpg)

Just like for the exploration sketches, the costuming and color design process consists of conceptualizing various clothing options with several colors palettes as well:

![image](./images/unnamed_203.jpg)

Hair and clothing variants are the most common alternative versions of the design you will do.

![image](./images/unnamed_544.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_753.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1266.jpg)

Researching clothing design can be lots of fun too.

![image](./images/unnamed_711.jpg)

Shapes, forms, proportions, anatomy, costuming and many other aspects of "style" must be experimented with. The word itself, **style**, appears nearly 500 times in this document - because it has such a broad definition that covers many aspects of visual art. Once certain parts of a character are nailed down, there may still be other aspects that need further exploration. Usually [clothes][FeXjmiKEpB] and hair are specific areas that can be further explored separately to show many more possible varieties, to see what feels best. As they say with actors; the hair styles, make-up and costume choices help to define the characters:

![image](./images/unnamed_1258.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_011.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_275.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1655.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1601.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_193.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1256.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1609.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_750.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_842.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_115.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1660.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1424.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1401.png)

Just like an actor, **costuming** and **hair styling** alone can be an entirely grand and long venture to embark upon to discover the many outfits your character can have and which costume should be their default. However, with over 40 years of [The Simpsons][HCPRBonMoz], you'll notice they've worn the same clothes the whole time. The reason for this is because it can be difficult in the production pipeline to change a character's outfits, it's more efficient to keep them usually the same as often as possible, when you have a large crew of animators across several studios producing a series.

#### Concept Art

Exploration drawings (shown above), along with research drawings, visual development art, character development art, predesign art and concept art - all serve the same purpose, and they can be black and white, rough, clean, or color - but these can all be considered the _conceptual stage_ of design. Sometimes concept art is loose and rough character sketches, sometimes it's full color, or mixtures of rough colors thrown in with some greyscale tonal studies, or just rough black-and-white line art. It can have roughly painted environments integrated with them, displaying what a snapshot of a scene could look like (color keys or lighting keys), fully illustrated with the character placed in a location. Concept Art is simply short for "_Conceptual Artwork_".

Here's concept art for 'Puckhead' by _Tavis Silbernagel_. Developed for a video game that was meant to be a parody/ripoff of [Cuphead][vOfCqznaEg]:

Character Development Art by _Chris Sanders:_

![image](./images/unnamed_382.jpg)

Teacher [Jazno Francoeur][DNOOqxTtni] explains: Chris Sanders' development work on **Lilo & Stitch** is a masterclass in unified vision---where design, story, and tone emerged from a singular voice. His loose, expressive linework radiates warmth, roundness, and imperfection, making the characters feel handmade and emotionally immediate. These weren't just sketches; they were the DNA of the film's identity. Sanders, in collaboration with Dean DeBlois, carved a heartfelt, offbeat narrative that broke Disney convention by grounding the story in personal, familial stakes rather than traditional fairy tale tropes. His clarity of vision permeated every department. I recall animating a sequence where the genetic guns blast through the bay doors on the mothership---my instinct was to have the blasts scatter randomly. Chris paused and said, "Think of it like a rotating Gatling gun---clockwise, circular." That suggestion reframed the entire moment and made the scene work better in regards to both timing and design. Suddenly, it wasn't chaos---it was controlled rhythm. That's Chris in a nutshell - not just a designer of characters, but a shaper of moments, bringing purpose and clarity to even the smallest beat. The film's enduring charm owes much to that meticulous yet intuitive touch.

#### Pre-Design/VisDev

Visual Development, Pre-Design, Concept Design, all interchangeable terms relating to the process of researching styles, developing the character art style, creating exploration sketches, and producing color roughs. It's all about 'finding the look' \-- sometimes the style is already locked in, but you still need to try out lots of different options to see which one works best with the character's description and personality\...

### Character Turnaround

Now that you've collected all your references, sketched out lots of concepts and exploration drawings, and started choosing which roughs to nail down for the look of your character, based upon any prerequisites or parameters you might have to follow. You are now beginning to lock down what it is you (and your supervisor/director/client) are looking for. You are now ready to get started in producing the actual individual views of the character design by refining the look and various angles of the character's physiology. Here you begin to explore how the structure and anatomy of the character work, it's time to begin developing a model sheet for your character!

![image](./images/unnamed_1286.png)

#### The Rotation

It starts with the 5 basic views, allowing yourself and others to see how the characters look when rotated and viewed from different sides.

![image](./images/unnamed_444.png)

To illustrate a character model sheet or turn-around sheet, typically you will be required to draw your character from 3-5 different angles, to develop a rotation (or [partial rotation][eTXtqJtTQm]). Depending on how much of a main or primary character they are in the story, this will determine how many views will need to be produced, the more present they are in the story, the greater the chance the animators will need more reference to know what the character looks like from different sides. Another factor is the style of the animation (will it require lots of turning or changing perspectives), You may need 5, 8 or even 14 views to fully see the character from all views to ensure consistency. But to start off, your primary views will typically include: **front**, **front three-quarter(3/4)**, **side (profile)**, **back** and **back three-quarter** views.

![image](./images/unnamed_676.png)

> With the initial 5 views completed, you'll have the foundation to create many more.

##### 1 - Draw the front view of your character

The first pose is the frontal view. Your standard turnaround should have 5-views of the same character: a **front view**, a **back view**, a **side (profile) view**, a **3/4 front view** and a **3/4 back view**, these all help modelers/builders and animators better understand the volume & structure of the character and what details are seen from various rotations. But a 4-view turnaround works good too, it's the bare minimum for most productions, but for asymmetrical characters you may need up to 8-views to accurately get the full rotation, since the left and right sides of their bodies aren't mirrored.

![image](./images/unnamed_195.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1051.png)

**Symmetry:**

![image](./images/unnamed_806.png)

**Asymmetry:**

![image](./images/unnamed_1219.png)

**Symmetrical:**

![image](./images/unnamed_879.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1280.png)

Also be mindful and producing any draw-throughs, to show any areas that might be covered up by hair, clothing, or overlapping body parts:

![image](./images/unnamed_910.png)

A good way to ensure consistency between the different views you will be drawing next is to use one of the poses as a background, and the frontal view is the best one to start with.

![What Is a Turnaround in Character Design and How To Draw One 3](./images/unnamed_1547.png)

##### 2 - Create some guidelines

Once you have your character\'s frontal view, place some guidelines at different levels to keep consistency between the poses. These lines will help the character have the same height throughout the sequence, but also maintain the proportions of the different parts of its body.

Accuracy in the proportions and positions of all the elements of your character's rotation is always important. Creating these guides in Photoshop is very simple. Just drag the mouse from the document rulers. Make sure that the \"Snap to\...\" function is not active because it will make the drawing process difficult.

![What Is a Turnaround in Character Design and How To Draw One 5](./images/unnamed_729.png)

##### 3 - Draw the 3/4 view

The 3/4 pose next, using the front view as a template. Imagine what the features of the character would look like if they were a little tilted. The nose and other facial features will have to be altered slightly and not quite in the same position. The shoulders, symmetrical in the front view, will now change and have slightly different sizes. The legs will no longer be the same size, either. One will be wider than the other because it will be closer to the imaginary point of view.

![image](./images/unnamed_890.jpg)

Once you have made the first approach to drawing the new 3/4 pose, do the flipping or mirroring method. It will be easier to see if something doesn\'t have the proportions it should.

It\'s essential to pay attention to the feet and the relationship with
the ground and make sure they don\'t appear to be shifted.

![image](./images/unnamed_1352.png)

> If your eye level is at the waist, then lines above the mid-section will gradually curve slightly upwards, and lines below the mid-section will gradually curve slightly downwards. See [here][cbwTsQENPZ] for more info about this.

All characters follow some sort of perspective rules, same as any geometric shapes:

![image](./images/unnamed_036.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_515.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_714.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1129.png)

Notice the ground plane that the character designs stand on, sometimes it's flat, like they're standing on a flat line, other times they are in perspective.

> Pay attention to consistency in foot placement & perspective for the turn-around views:

![image](./images/unnamed_1300.png)

Also, in this above example, the camera would be in line with her eyes, not her waist, this is more common in character sheets with turnarounds, Notice her collar, sleeves, belt, pants all curve downwards.

Even when certain character designs only follow their own rules of flat-graphically-stylized perspective, some 'cheats' need to be made to have the characters look good in whichever views they're being depicted in:

![image](./images/unnamed_792.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_068.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_607.png)

##### 4 - Check the guidelines

Once the first rough drawing of the pose is finished, check the guidelines to make sure everything aligns properly. Not all of the elements will at first, but that\'s ok. Just make adjustments and corrections as needed.

It is essential to spend a good deal of time on this and check carefully because it is better to notice any possible mistakes now than when we are already working with the refined version of the drawing.

![What Is a Turnaround in Character Design and How To Draw One 7](./images/unnamed_1178.png)

One of the most important things to remember when drawing your [character turnaround][OYcNAFtLGc] is that each part of your character should line up exactly in each angle. A good way to make sure you are getting your proportions correctly is to [draw guidelines][edNUilwYOA] that correspond with key elements of your character. Example: top of the head, eyes, nose, mouth, shoulders, and other key parts of the body and costume, and where the joints are.

##### 5 - Draw the side view

For the side view, it is crucial to consider that it is the pose that will show the character\'s volume, especially for facial features like the nose or lips. Some designers draw the arm as a separate detail in this view or raised up so that it doesn't block what the torso looks like, but it\'s up to you. Don\'t forget, as with the rest of the poses, to check that every element is properly aligned before refining the lines of your sketch.

##### 6 - Draw the back view and 3/4 back view

The 3/4 back view might be one of the trickiest poses, but don\'t despair. The back view is more straightforward. Just copy the front view\'s silhouette and add all the elements in the back of the character. You may never have considered what your character looks like from behind, things like how long the hair is, or what decal might be imprinted on the back of their sweater, for example. These are important details in a turnaround because modelers (builders/riggers) will use them to achieve a more faithful character reproduction.

![What Is a Turnaround in Character Design and How To Draw One 9](./images/unnamed_299.png)

Then comes cleaning up the linework and choosing final colors (more about this later, in the [Color Styling](#color-styling) chapter). Often providing a few different color schemes and variants can be helpful if you have a producer/director or client needing to do approvals on your work - offering a few choices can be helpful in arriving at a consensus for the final color pass.

![What Is a Turnaround in Character Design and How To Draw One 1](./images/unnamed_1428.png)

Depending on your chosen line art style, your [clean-up][PbnjpfamUJ] pass is essentially tracing your rough artwork with a 'final line', ensuring consistency and volumes are maintained. Study other design [critiques][pSIOtMTgCT] to learn from other designers\' improvements.

**Head Angles** are an additional aspect that is common to include in more detailed model sheets:

![image](./images/unnamed_1411.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_524.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_694.jpg)

Head angles can be challenging to do, combinations of cheating the perspective to make the angle work while still making it "look good" is key.

![image](./images/unnamed_1271.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_695.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_481.jpg)

Here's another similar approach to the turnaround process...

Rough out some concepts to discover who your character is for their look and personality. Produce exploration drawings to find the shapes, structure, and style you're going for:

![image](./images/unnamed_1409.png)

Then refine your character(s) down to a few possible body types:

![image](./images/unnamed_1030.png)

Refine and lock down the look and structure of your character.
To make your turnaround views, setup your horizontal lines, use them as your guide - rough out basic forms:

![image](./images/unnamed_512.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1183.png)

Then a detail pass (roughs) to refine the shapes, make decisions on anatomy, clothing, hair:

![image](./images/unnamed_323.png)

Line Art pass (clean-up) - pay attention to the accuracy of the rotation, the volumes and proportions of all body parts relative to one and other - the position of all details and any revisions and adjustments you want to make:

![image](./images/unnamed_184.png)

Color pass - start off with flat colors as seen here, but this may also include shading & shadows, if that's the style you're going for:

![image](./images/unnamed_1476.png)

> 👉 [Here's a great short summary of this process][dwqjcAxqHI]

Finding useful [templates][UsFuviQhMw] (or creating one of your own) can have you be more efficient when reusing the same body types for multiple characters.

Sometimes the drawing of the character in each view is in a different pose, instead of the standard arms resting on their sides or pointing outwards in the same postures for each view, this is purely the preference of the designer and their supervisor/director.

![image](./images/unnamed_1565.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1000.jpg)

Sometimes, all you need is 2 or 3 views because the amount of screen time they have is short and limited and they do not animate to make full turns in the scenes they are in. This saves you time by not designing more views than is needed, the storyboard will show how much they are moving, so always refer to that. From this information you can determine how many views are actually required, if there are no [storyboards][GGiTaVxwLS] to reference, then start off with the first view (3/4) and once that is approved, depending on the time you have and the requirements set out by your director/supervisor, you complete, 3, 4, 5 point turnaround views as your time restrictions allows.

When there's a team of designers, often two views are enough to get general approvals from all necessary people in the production. A junior designer or assistant designer then completes all the other views of the turn. The lead character designer or designer supervisor or art director then approved the accuracy of the additional turn around views.

Don't forget to have those guidelines there as reference for the position and volume of your character as you figure out how to make the rotation for the turn-around:

Once you have completed the design you can hide the guidelines and you should be left with something that looks like a finished design turnaround sheet. Of course, don't be afraid to revise and refine your work to perfect the rotation of your character.

5-pt turnarounds are probably the most common set you will produce. This is because it covers all the basics you need. With these first 5 views, it's easy to expand to 8 or 12 view rotations.

In 2D animation, most of the time designers need to 'cheat' the look of each individual view since most times they are drawn not how they would actually look three-dimensionally, but more how they should look to appear the most appealing from that angle.

**How many views must you create for your character?**

This often depends on the production's needs and even the time constraints of the schedule. The more primary the character is, the more screen-time they'll have, the more views and references need to be drawn. Usually the script and [storyboards][RuSmScFWJf] are a good indicator of how much the character will be present on-screen for. The more screen-time they have, the more they'll act and move around, therefore the more likely you'll need more views in their rotation for the model sheets to depict how they'll look from various sides. Main characters will be seen the most and will be in the most episodes (in a series) and therefore will need more references since more robust and refined builds will need to be made since they will be doing the most action and [acting][VZPMRybOIg].

Sometimes **4-point turnarounds** consist of the **3/4 Front**, **Front**, **Side**, **3/4 Back views**, other times they consist of **Front**, **3/4 Front**, **3/4 Back**, **Back views**:

It's just a matter of preference and often what the storyboards will show to be visible in the shots the characters will appear in. The less scenes and the less turns they will do, the less likely you will need to create multiple views for that character.

There's also an optional 5/8 and 7/8 views (the views between the Front and 3/4, and between 3/4 and Side), sometimes called _Off Centre Left_ and _Off Center Right_ (depending on which way they're facing) or _Front Near Left_ / _Front Near Right_, these are usually reserved for the main cast of characters, since they get lots more screen-time than incidental or secondary characters. Adding these inbetween views makes for a more complete rotation, examples of this further below.

To distinguish between these inbetween views like 5/8 and 7/8.

Remember that 5/8 is between the Front and 3/4, and 7/8 is between the 3/4 and Side:

![image](./images/unnamed_925.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1338.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_172.png)

Adding in these in-between views creates 10 and 12 point rotations.

**10-point turnarounds:**

![image](./images/unnamed_1084.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_508.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_117.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_183.png)

Even more inbetween views can be made, it all depends on the production style of the animation, and what is demanded of the characters in their stories. 12 point Turnarounds can have an additional view between the Side view and 3/4 Back view as well, or additional view between the 3/4 Front view and Side view. You could add more inbetween views for the full rotation, adding up to a 16 point turnaround.

**12-point turnarounds:**

![image](./images/unnamed_1047.jpg)

In addition, there's the view between the 3/4 Back and the Back View, these would be called **5/8 Back View**, as seen here.

![image](./images/unnamed_1407.jpg)

Sometimes you will need to create new poses between each main view of an 8-point rotation, to make it a 16-point turnaround:

![image](./images/unnamed_768.png)

It may seem technical or complicated, but when it comes to adding more inbetween views; these are actually easier to draw because it\'s a very close reference to the views around the ones you've already made. It becomes only a slight rotation change, often reusing the same artwork, and only shifting and turning the body parts slightly in perspective to complete these new views.

Turnarounds are not the only type of character model sheet you will want to create for builds artists and animators to reference. Some other common design sheets include: Expression Sheets, Pose Sheets, Color Keys, Hand Models, Mouth Charts, and various Style Guides!

### Expression Sheets

Creating an expression sheet is a great way to provide the animators with a basic guide on the way a character expresses different emotions. Try to include a combination of extreme and subtle expressions in your illustrations for these model sheets. Expression sheets are super fun to sketch as you can really explore a range of personalities for your character.

The type of the show and the stories being portrayed decide on the exaggeration level and range that can be pushed for facial expression styles. It can vary from subtle to extreme, experimenting is in order to discover what the limitations are.

Depending on the style of the design, your expressions may be reserved and subtle, or quite exaggerated with lots of squash & stretch. There's always a range to experiment with between realism and cartoony-ness.

![image](./images/unnamed_1232.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_797.png)

Have fun with poses and facial expressions - What you will find helpful in the design stage is sketching the characters in action (poses) as well as their facial expressions, to see what feels right and suits them best. Think about how this character would act in different situations. What kind of faces do they make when they are happy or excited or angry?

![image](./images/unnamed_146.png)

Let them emote and communicate! This is the moment when the characters reveal themselves and truly come to life.

Head tilts and rotations can be difficult to do, often you need to create a [construction][pXlCPOjLve] reference for yourself to see how it will look three-dimensionally. This way you can plan out how to accurately to show the facial features at various angles:

![image](./images/unnamed_1372.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_021.png)

[Head Angles][GZHFBuvLfI] or Head Charts are sometimes part of the Expressions Sheets, sometimes part of the Posing Sheets, sometimes they're a designated design asset on their own. [Head angles][dSeyJmTZcw] like this are common to be made for primary characters for important reference material for animators:

![image](./images/unnamed_1209.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1620.png)

Breaking down a character design's expressions can be great learning practice:

![image](./images/unnamed_1204.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1115.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1095.png)

Create your expressions to be unmistakably clear as to what they're doing, how they're feeling, and what is happening. Basically, always think about producing strong poses & expressions, not ambiguous ones.

An inspirational example here is some old _Tiny Toons_ expression sheets. There were some fantastic moments and some incredible animation shown in this series, and a few times some crazy over-the-top & hilarious situations were shown. The cartooniest and most enthusiastic artist on the crew was **Eddie Fitzgerald**. Here are some of his sketches of the _Tiny Toons_ cast:

![image](./images/unnamed_1475.jpg)

This Buster character looks pretty conservative for Eddie. His exaggerated style of expressions seem a bit subdued here, but these are still really good, really pushed, and great inspiration.

![image](./images/unnamed_841.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_607.jpg)

There\'s soooo much to learn from these. It\'s free, loose, energetic, and seemingly effortless drawings of expressions and body language. These show a special love for the character. Late in Eddie's career, he actually got to storyboard on the 1999 version of _Woody Woodpecker_ too.

![image](./images/unnamed_221.jpg)

Check out these awesome expressions. You have to be a real cartoonist to realize the creative beauty and humorous potential of Warner Bros\' seemingly most conservative character.

![image](./images/unnamed_350.jpg)

These are some more great poses. It\'s weird to see Porky wearing pants, but somehow Eddie manages to draw it well. He knows what people like about the old Porky Pig character.

![image](./images/unnamed_618.jpg)

You know somebody can really draw if they like to do back poses - and can make them funny! Many artists are afraid of drawing characters from the back - not Eddie. He embraces the backside.

![image](./images/unnamed_1319.jpg)

See how he can get perfectly clear poses, construction and attitudes in just a few lines on a tiny thumbnail drawing. Eddie\'s storyboards would be super fun to lay out, because he\'s done the hard part for you. You can\'t go wrong with appealing poses like this.

Here\'s some Plucky Duck expressions that look way better being rough and exaggerated than the final version that got toned-down on screen.

![image](./images/unnamed_889.jpg)

Eddie was one of the first directors during the idealistic days of _Tiny Toons_\' birth in 1989, and he was the perfect choice for the job. He had a unique vision, a strong individual drawing style and a really funny way of seeing the world. Plus, he intimately knew all the original _Looney Tunes_ cartoons that they were basing these baby versions on.

Use this as inspiration to stay loose in your roughs, be exaggerated, and use the wild poses/expressions as a starting point, then tone down, refine, and afterwards, reduce them down to the style and structure they need to be.

### Pose Sheets

Similar to expression sheets, pose sheets/action poses are used to show the type of gestures a character is likely to make. These can be really important to provide your animators with information on the way a character moves in accordance with their personality and how far to push dynamic poses as well. Whilst traditional character turnaround sheets can feel a bit stiff, pose sheets allow for a much wider range of motions and body language to be expressed.

![image](./images/unnamed_1257.png)

Your poses are meant to be the tip of the iceberg, making the observer wonder: what's this character's back story, and giving hints as to their personality and intentions.

- 👉 Inspiration for how to practice drawing the structure and volumes of your characters [here][PJLHYNuRvD].
- 👉 Inspiration for poses can be found everywhere, like "dynamic action posing" as we see [here][PKnbwZDnDV].

Use **C-Curves** and **S-Curves** in contrast when Posing your characters:

![image](./images/unnamed_567.png)

The **line of action** is a key ingredient to making your character's poses look more dynamic.

This helps your poses \"read\", it makes them clear and understandable and gives them a distinct non-ambiguous direction.

**Body language** is a crucial element in character design, used to convey a character\'s personality, emotions, and intentions through posture, gestures, and movement. It\'s a visual shorthand that helps audiences understand a character\'s inner state and relationship with others, even without dialogue. It\'s a visual shorthand that helps audiences understand a character\'s inner state and relationship with others, even without dialogue.

- **Conveying Personality:**
  - Body language can be used to visually represent a character\'s traits. For example, a confident character might have an upright posture, open body language (like hands on hips with relaxed shoulders), and a wide stance. A nervous character might slouch, cross their arms, shoulders up, and have a downcast gaze.
- **Expressing Emotions:**
  - Different postures and gestures can indicate various emotions, like joy, fear, confidence, or doubt. A character lowering or raising their hands might express fear, while a character with a straight back and head held high might convey confidence.
- **Showing Intentions:**
  - Body language can also reveal a character\'s intentions. For example, a character leaning forward might indicate they are trying to engage in conversation, while a character looking away might be trying to avoid something.
- **Building Relationships:**
  - Eye contact and how characters physically relate to each other (e.g., touching, embracing, or keeping a distance) can also convey the nature of their relationship.
- **Considering Context:**
  - The context of the scene and the overall style of the project (e.g., realistic drama, cartoon comedy) will also influence the type of body language used. A realistic drama might require subtle and nuanced body language, while a cartoon comedy might be more exaggerated.
- **Individual Voice:**
  - Each character should have their own unique body language, reflecting their personality and habits. Universal gestures (like smiling, nodding, or shaking hands) can be supplemented with individual quirks, like shaking a leg when nervous or avoiding eye contact.

Drawing your characters in various perspectives and angles can be the most difficult thing to do, especially when the design of your character is very flat and stylized, they may not be very "three-dimensionally-friendly".

As you can see, **Pose Sheets** have expressions illustrated in them as well. Full body poses + facial expressions will serve as double the information for those using it as reference.

**Pushing the pose** doesn't always mean exaggerating the gesture to the max - it means that each exaggeration is further supporting the 'big idea' of the pose with readable emotions:

**What does your pose say about your character?**

![Example of shoulder up "aggressive" and shoulder down "passive" poses](./images/unnamed_952.jpg)

The pose you choose for your character can communicate a lot about their personality, emotions, and desires. For example, using a concave (c-shaped,) line of action for your character's pose can help them seem timid or sad, whereas a convex curve can be used to make them seem more confident or happy.

So, before you choose your pose, think about what you want to say about your character and how you can best illustrate this information through curves, tilts, and expressions!

![One character six sitting poses](./images/unnamed_244.jpg)

There are so many different ways you can alter your character's pose to make it more effective.

![image](./images/unnamed_921.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_716.png)

Once you have got your pose roughed out, you can start thinking about how you will pose your character. An easy way to check whether or not your pose is working is to create a silhouette of the pose and see if it still reads well. Good poses are easily understandable even when silhouetted!

Block in the character. If you can still recognize what their body language is doing, then it has a strong, readable silhouette.

![image](./images/unnamed_1329.png)

By making strong posing choices for your characters you will greatly improve the readability of your character designs!

![image](./images/unnamed_1059.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_819.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1210.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1460.png)

Recognizability in silhouettes can be great for your audience to instantly identify the character on screen.

![image](./images/unnamed_093.png)

Especially when making a cast of various characters, some thought should be put into the character's outer shape. Ideally some contrast between a pair or trio of characters makes for a more appealing ensemble.

![image](./images/unnamed_1511.png)

When posing your character, you will come across some logistics you may not have considered before:

![image](./images/unnamed_560.png)

\*Not all design styles have varied line weight or tapered lines, so follow the style reference first and foremost, if you are designing the characters and determining these varied [line weights][SErFxVZBuS], experiment with and without them, and consult your director/producer/client for any advice on preferences and how it can impact things down the line in builds and animation.

To discover the range of motion with your characters, begin with rough thumbnails drawings:

**Stages of Drawing Poses:**

![image](./images/unnamed_531.png)

Thumbnail - Rough - Clean-up - Color

The thumbnail/rough stage of posing allows you to see aspects of the character you couldn't see before. Look back to what you found out about the character before you started designing, when researching different aspects of the character, you're being purely creative and exploring, you do a Turnaround but once you start POSING your character, you see areas in the design that might need to be revisited and tweaked. It's like taking your model out for a _test drive_.

Then you enter the "clean-up" phase where you refine the posing, correct any issues with [proportions][EXidESPzYn], volumes and find the final line you want to have.

![image](./images/unnamed_060.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_440.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_938.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_1022.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_692.jpg)

When posing, start off loose and rough to get a feel of how the character's acting and attitudes could come through.

Sometimes pose sheets and expression sheets can be combined, their purpose is always to show animators and builders/riggers what the range of anatomy and flexibility is intended for the character's style, and how to illustrate various attitudes and postures.

See Victor Navone's collection of thumbnail sketches [here][KzeqASNAjY]. He developed these to work out the posing and acting for the characters in his shots prior to animating his scenes. Created as a way to rehearse the poses for the best performance and actions, finding the attitude and mindset of the characters. He'd use these sketches as a way to explore how to depict their mood and body language.

**Variations & Re-dressing:**

Often, creating variations in costuming and hair styling can be common practice before full turnarounds are drawn. This way the director can see what looks better for the purposes of the story, location, and the sequence the characters are in.

![image](./images/unnamed_1211.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1586.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1339.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_908.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_867.png)

Other variations are often designed for extras and secondary or incidental characters, they serve as background filler and often share similar interchangeable design traits to keep things efficient and simple:

![image](./images/unnamed_077.png)

By Marta Andreeva

Incidental characters are usually background crowds or random extras needing to populate the scene, reacting to the events transpiring in the shots. Sometimes you're able to re-use body types, interchange clothing, hair styles and skin tones in order to be more efficient with your time and to easily add variety amongst a crowd of characters.

![image](./images/unnamed_871.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1291.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1188.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_937.jpg)

Variations in age are more rare, but still a possibility depending on the story being told with the character. For example, if there will be flashbacks (or flash-forwards) or visual ways to chronologically depict the character at various stages in their life, then variants in the designs to show younger and older versions will be needed. In which case, displaying the states of their changing physical appearance needs to be mapped out.

![image](./images/unnamed_1457.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_519.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_744.png)

Sometimes when developing the character, variations are requested to make them a bit older or younger, adjusting [proportions][tJwigYIbKD] and hairstyles/clothing can go a long way in showing these iterations.

![image](./images/unnamed_988.png)

Pose sheets can be made up from the drawings created out of **Character Layouts** and **Special Poses** too. These are certain moments captured from the storyboards that need to be redrawn in more details and placed on-style, here's samples of this from Marc Bachand:

### Color Styling

A **color stylist** (also known as color designers) chooses the colors for characters, props, and FX in an animated production.

Using their knowledge of color theory, their skills as a painter, and their design sensibilities, they create palettes and lighting that allows the characters to fit within the backgrounds and match the overall style of the show.

As always, it's important to remember no two productions are alike, and the roles of a color stylist can vary greatly from show to show.

![image](./images/unnamed_196.jpg)

When a color stylist first begins on a show they will receive information from the Art Director about the style of the show and the various painting approaches that are employed when coloring the characters. This is known as a style guide.

Whether an actual document or just a conversation with the Art Director, the style guide serves to give parameters to the color stylists to help the character treatments look consistent.

For example, a style guide might say such things as...

> _"The shadows of the characters are always hard edged and so when you are blocking out shadows, use the lasso tool."_

![image](./images/unnamed_329.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_442.png)

> 👉 [The Color Wheel and How it Works!][ziHXPZcBXE]

Terms to know:

- Hue is color (blue, green, red, etc.)
- Chroma is the purity of a color (a high chroma has no added black, white or gray)
- Saturation refers to how strong or weak a color is (high saturation being strong/vibrant)
- Value refers to how light or dark a color is (light having a high value)
- Tones are created by adding gray to a color, making it duller than the original
- Shades are created by adding black to a color, making it darker than the original
- Tints are created by adding white to a color, making it lighter than the original

#### Handout

The color stylist's job begins once the clean black and white character designs have been approved and turned.

Similar to the other design positions, the color stylist receives their new assignments from the Art Director along with any caveats or specific instructions the Art Director would like for the color scheme.

The Art Director will also give them any context for the character/scene that may affect color.

Once the Art Director has delegated the designs, it's off to the races!

![image](./images/unnamed_1067.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_626.jpg)

#### Paint With All The Colors

While the Art Director may have some specific thoughts about certain aspects of the character, the color stylist for the most part makes all of the decisions about the color schemes of the character from hair color to skin color to outfit color/coordination.

Occasionally there may be characters that directly references or parody a real person and in these specific cases, the palette might be pulled from the reference in order to help it as a reference or something already in existence.

![image](./images/unnamed_836.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1423.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1120.jpg)

Sometimes "color roughs" are needed, where the artwork is still rough, but a color pass is needed:

![image](./images/unnamed_1380.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_450.jpg)

#### Matching The Backgrounds

Another very important consideration the color designer has to make is whether the character's color scheme/treatment will make sense against the background.

Often, color stylists will bring in the finished backgrounds where available to make sure that the color scheme of the world and the color scheme of the character are logical and aesthetically pleasing.

![image](./images/unnamed_1405.png)

Your character colors can clash with the background, it's always good to make a quick test to see:

![image](./images/unnamed_638.jpg)

#### Color Design Review

Once the color stylist has done a few color iterations (usually 3 to 5) of the character in 3/4 front view, it is time for the Art Director and Showrunner to review.

The Showrunner will pick their preferred color scheme from the line... or possibly frankenstein pieces from different versions.

For example: The Showrunner may say, _"Let's use the hair from #1, but the skin tone and outfit from #4"_

The color design usually goes through two or three reviews before it is approved.

Once the 3/4 front view colored version of the character is approved, the color stylist will then go in and paint the rest of the black and white turn around.

![image](./images/unnamed_483.png)

It's a full time job because you have to do that for every single character, prop, or FX in every single lighting situation that happens in a show. The character designer(s) on a production can sometimes do the colors for their own characters. The smaller the production, the more tasks each artist is made to do. On small productions, a designer may have to do concepts, roughs, turnarounds, clean-up and colors for all the design assets they create. While on larger productions, those tasks could be divided up amongst 4 or 5 different people since there is such a large amount of characters to do each week, designing characters, props and color styling ALL of them.

![image](./images/unnamed_1273.png)

Color Design might sound like a relatively simple job, but it's not. You have to take into account a lot of things: how the colors will read on multiple surfaces and backgrounds (and clashing with multiple colors within one background), when you should have shadows on the model, how the shadow actually affects the model, why you're choosing cool colors or warm colors, how colors look after they've been compressed to be seen on phones versus broadcast TV/streaming, and even the subconscious meaning of colors culturally/psychologically.

> 👉 See [here][uZSpMhLFdX] for how color combinations can be applied.

Colors combinations can help to create a very iconic casts of character:

![image](./images/unnamed_896.png)

#### Local Colors and Lighting

Color stylists create and set the character palettes for the characters, props and FX within an episode, taking into account lighting changes that might happen while said elements are on screen. Something that can vary from show to show is whether color stylists are responsible for doing the light adjustments for characters under different lighting conditions.

Local Colors (the base colors of a character under neutral lighting) can be greatly impacted by the lighting of specific shots.

_For example: A scene takes place in a nightclub with neon lights could turn a brunette character's hair bright pink or have rim lights added on._

Sometimes color stylists do these lighting passes, and sometimes they are done by the Art Director.

If you watch the [Infinity Train][reCiPfWneU] [pilot][FoigFWwsLV], Tulip is a different color palette in the puzzle car, a different palette outside, a different palette in the corgi car, a different palette inside the temple, and a different palette in the foggy area. Then she has to have a different palette every time she looks at glowing numbers on her hand in each of those locations. All of that just for one character, not including any props or lighting that affects other characters.

Here's a quick rundown from that pilot episode (note, the colors are a little washed out because the screenshots were from youtube, but you can still see the difference):

![image](./images/unnamed_1005.jpg)

As you can see, she doesn't just have a green hoodie, she has like 9 different green hoodies. When eye-dropping these colors, there are colors in there you don't even realize were being used in there. These are all decisions that a color stylist makes.

> 👉 Here's an excellent portfolio example from an experienced color stylist: [Grey Chen][FWSnjwqNeQ]

Here's a short guide by [Jess Marfisi][YBUtjoolAD]:

![image](./images/unnamed_1459.jpg)

For example, a character wouldn't be colored the same in broad daylight than in complete darkness, right?

![image](./images/unnamed_789.jpg)

[LINK][rxQkTmHLsv]

So **Props** and **FX** need to be colored as well, keeping the character and background colors in mind while designing the color palettes, so that they will go well together side-by-side. Every object that a character touches and every puff of smoke or falling leaves that might show up in an episode all need to be designed.

A pool cleaner from the _Craig of the Creek_ episode ["Lost in the Sewers"][aaoHyvdaaJ]. Note that the color stylists have set the palette for when the object is in shadow.

> 👉 Here's an excellent portfolio example from an experienced color stylist: [Cam Chan][rLIjtPxWIK]

This can vary from show to show, not all productions have the color stylish responsible for exclusively character colors, it's common for them to also do all the colors for other objects and FX. On some productions, the color stylist is responsible for any color design that is not a background.

On other productions, there may be a whole other designer for props, oftentimes a prop designer both creates the designs and colors for all hand-held objects featured in the series.

![image](./images/unnamed_1009.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1619.png)

Another thing that can improve the effectiveness of your character design sheet is a color guide! To do this, all you need is a simple key of all the color swatches used in the character design, alongside an example illustration of the character in full color. This is really helpful when you are handing off a design for a whole team of artists to use, as it ensures all of the colors remain consistent.

> "Digital media gives access to every color out there. While this is truly amazing, I think limiting yourself to a few key colors is actually a better strategy. Using a limited color palette helps a sketch feel cohesive. Using too many colors can sometimes create a sense of messiness and a lack of focus. I would say to stick with between one and three primary colors initially. Afterwards, you can dive between the values of each tone when detailing. I truly believe that color is the most important piece of the puzzle when creating eye-catching art. I've done a few "tests" on social media. When posting a drawing with no color, versus the same drawing with added colors, the latter will always get a stronger reception. So if it vibes with your artistic vision: be bright, be bold. It also doesn't hurt to get inspiration from photos or other artists' color palettes." -Erik Ly

![image](./images/unnamed_260.jpg)

#### Right on Schedule

Similar to both background design and character design, there are usually about 2 weeks allotted in a production schedule for color design for each episode, however the timeframe can vary. These 2-week-cycles include producing the color concepts, having them reviewed, painting the one view of the character again, having that reviewed, revising those colors, then painting the other views, at least 5 views for a primary characters and at least 2 views for a secondary/incidental character, and usually you are working on two episodes at once, with multiple characters, with some partial re-use and re-dressing from previous episodes, and all overlapping at various stages.

Color stylists usually finish around 3 to 4 fully-colored character turns per day. Sometimes a very extensive character may take more iterations of exploration.

#### Rim Light and Rim Shadow

Sometimes you need to make a custom color palette for night time scenes, which includes creating samples for light sources and how they are painted.

![image](./images/unnamed_788.jpg)

Sometimes it's not just a dark tint, but an entirely new color scheme:

![image](./images/unnamed_1002.jpg)

Night time colors with shadows:

![image](./images/unnamed_1378.jpg)

#### Workflow Pipeline

Start off with only coloring one view at a time, you want your color palette approved before applying it to all the other turns.

Also, if you were not the one that designed the characters (you are painting someone else's design) can you communicate with them about "color details"? - This is the discretion of adding in some highlights or shading or the removal of lines once the shape is painted.

![image](./images/unnamed_049.jpg)

Or the adding of textures or patterns, like this:

![image](./images/unnamed_1172.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1017.jpg)

Because character design can sometimes shift right up until the episode's assets go out to the Builds Artists and Scene Setup crew, sometimes color design can also be tweaked after the design was already approved. It's not the norm, but it happens!

![image](./images/unnamed_1016.jpg)

Most shows have a level of flexibility and fluidity in their pipeline to account for changes that may occur along the way.

No pipeline is perfect and TV animation schedules are notoriously hectic with many many moving parts all working at the same time with various stages all overlapping each other with many levels of changes and adjustments being made on every design asset right up until they get given to the animation crew.

![image](./images/unnamed_1341.jpg)

#### Who Do I Work With? - Part two

Primarily, color stylists work closest with the Art Director, this is the person foremost in charge of the overall look of the series.

The Art Director guides and supports the designers to make sure all the color treatments suit the style of the show.

Color Stylists may communicate with Character Designers to discuss their black and white designs which are the basis the color stylists work off of.

![image](./images/unnamed_246.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1550.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_513.png)

#### Alternates (ALT)

Sometimes creating versions of color schemes and surface details are referred to as ALTs.

![image](./images/unnamed_341.jpg)

#### Who Do I Affect? - Part two

Color Stylists most heavily affect the Builds team, they take the finished and approved color designs and convert them into rigged assets, which then goes to the Scene Setup (scene prep) crew to assemble each individual shot for each sequence of the episode, which then goes to the animation crew. When the animators open up their assigned scenes, they see everything has been imported, placed in, sized up and laid out for them to use, and then they can begin [animating][dHEZequKzE] the characters.

> Early color explorations models can be made to determine which combination works best:

#### COLOR CONCEPTS

![image](./images/unnamed_1092.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_693.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_134.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_149.png)

Placing the color exploration designs over the background art of the location the characters will be at, is usually a great way to see how the colors will work together. This way you can arrive at the colors most appropriate for the scene:

![image](./images/unnamed_839.png)

These can be called "color keys" as well, since they give you a snapshot of what a finished scene would look like.

So the background colors are usually more subject to change since we want the characters to stay consistent in their personal color schemes.

![image](./images/unnamed_199.png)

Color explorations are often needed to see which tones and palettes work best - for the purposes of character personality.

Also, placing your painted character in their environment (if one is available) is a good way to spot any clashing colors as well, or to adjust for the possibility of the character blending in with the background too much.

> 👉 [This Simple Color Theory Always Works!][ktrKnPFPIU]

![image](./images/unnamed_551.png)

Usually a character stays in their same outfit for the entire episode, and most of the time for entire lengths of multiple seasons! The Simpsons, for example, have been wearing the same clothes for over 40 years.

![image](./images/unnamed_1080.png)

Character "redress" is when a different versions is required to be designed for your character, this could be a drenched in water version, a dirty/muddy version, or a covered-in-paint version, but most commonly it's a hairstyle or costume change:

![image](./images/unnamed_801.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_724.jpg)

> 👉 [Wouter Tulp's Advice on Color!][YjBXckxSlT]

Sometimes less is more. You can limit the color palette for unity and impact. When working with three colors, keep the **60-30-10** rule in mind. Pick one color to make up about 60% of the character, a second color to make up about 30%, and the last color is about 10%.

![image](./images/unnamed_1234.png)

When working with just two colors, use the **70-30** rule. One color is about 70%, the second is about 30%.

![image](./images/unnamed_605.png)

Colors have a similar subconscious effect on our visual interpretation. Creating characters with an appealing and suitable color palette can make an immediate impact in grabbing and holding a viewer's attention. There are a few different aspects of color theory to consider when designing your character:

#### Symbolism

Each color carries its own innate effects on a color scheme. Red is universally alert and energetic, white is universally neutral. Warm colors are associated with action while cool ones are linked with calmness.

If you're creating content for an international audience it's worthwhile keeping in mind that different cultures have different views on color symbolism. Red, for example, can signify danger in the western world, but happiness in China. Likewise, blue represents freedom in many parts of Europe, but can symbolize villainy in Japan. Your intended audience will determine your use of [color symbolism][XVzLkpjNEA].

#### Color Relationships

The relationship between the different colors in your character design is just as important, if not more so, than the separate color significance. Some of the most well-known color arrangements include: monochromatic (different light values of the same hue); Complementary (two colors which are directly opposite each other on the color wheel), Analogous (colors which are adjacent on the color wheel), and Triadic (three colors spread around the color wheel in a triangle formation).

Each color scheme and color combo has its own advantages: monochromatic and analogous palettes are often soothing, complementary colors are both contrasting and harmonious, while triadic color schemes are dynamic and rich. Take a look at these color wheels and use these systems to help find a color scheme that'll be naturally pleasing to the eye.

![image](./images/unnamed_372.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1102.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1549.png)

You can see how the character's colors can showcase their personalities. How we perceive color's significance and meaning is both psychological and cultural.

> 👉 [Color Theory in Storytelling!][LSdmPuhiuI]

#### Complementary Colors

Complementary colors are the exact opposite of each other on the color wheel. This gives a highly contrasting and bold look. If you want your character to stand out, a complementary color scheme is perfect!

![Complementary color scheme](./images/unnamed_164.jpg)

As you can see in the below example, the use of complementary colors for a character design really allows for the details to pop in the illustration! This can be a useful tool when you are creating a protagonist who needs to be the focus of your drawing.

![A character design with complementary color scheme](./images/unnamed_1333.jpg)\@meikearts

#### Monochromatic Colors

A monochromatic color scheme uses only the tones, tints, and shades from a single hue on the color wheel. This creates a really unique and often emotive look in an illustration. If you are looking to make relatively simple color choices, this could be the best method for you!

![Monocromatic color scheme](./images/unnamed_835.jpg)

This color scheme is great for creating characters with well-defined traits that may be best expressed through a specific color. If you have a very complex character design, monochromatic colors can also help simplify their appearance and make it more visually appealing.

![image](./images/unnamed_1192.png)

A monochromatic color scheme is also a great choice if you are looking to improve your understanding of values when coloring and shading your work!

![Example of a character in monochromatic color](./images/unnamed_1143.jpg)\@meikearts

#### Triadic Colors

If you are looking to have a bit more variation in your color scheme, the Triadic method might be just what you need! These color combinations use 3 colors that are equally spaced apart on the color wheel.

When it comes to using triadic colors, it is best to choose one of the three to be the most prominent in your illustrations and use the other 2 for highlighting smaller details.

![Triadic color scheme](./images/unnamed_195.jpg)

This color scheme creates a very vibrant look, even when the colors are toned down. It is best used for characters with playful energy, as these color combinations can often feel very youthful. This makes triadic colors perfect for characters aimed at a younger audience!

![Example of triadic color scheme](./images/unnamed_568.jpg)\@meikearts

#### Warm vs Cool Colors

![Cool vs Warm Colors](./images/unnamed_278.jpg)

When it comes to using warm vs cool colors there are a few key things to consider. When added to an illustration, warm colored objects will typically feel closer to the viewer, whereas cooler ones will feel further away. This is because of atmospheric perspective, which is essentially just the effect of particles in the atmosphere making things further away have a bluish tint.

The color temperature of your characters will have a similar effect, for example, warmer-colored characters will stand out and feel confident, whereas cooler-toned characters may appear more closed off and mysterious.

Remember, sometimes there's added details that need to be inserted in. Like rotations of hands, the underneath area of hair, arms, robes, capes, cloaks and wings, including underneath the feet and the inside of mouths - these are all factors that need to be designed for certain productions in order to provide consistent design and color reference for animators later on.

- **Video essays to watch:**
- 👉 [Color Theory in Character Development 1][pgjizKEHsb]
- 👉 [Color Theory in Character Development 2][WMtwqyZUbL]

Consider incorporating colors that contrast with the main ones you intend to use in the production. This can help accentuate specific parts of the character that you want to highlight.

‍![image](./images/unnamed_368.png)

- 👉 [Suggestions for color combos][PonveIDUuM]
- 👉[Resource for color palettes][ljVQXqQcKs]

‍- Red: Passion, Love, Anger, Creativity

- Orange: Energy, Happiness, Vitality
- Yellow: Happiness, Hope, Deceit
- Green: New Beginnings, Abundance, Nature
- Blue: Calm, Responsible, Sadness
- Purple: Royalty, Wealth
- Black: Mystery, Elegance, Evil
- Gray: Moody, Conservative, Formality

![image](./images/unnamed_264.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1700.png)

Also, it's important to note that even though you can use as many colors as you want, it is recommended not to span the chromatic variance of the characters too much due to the simplicity of the models.

Example of the muted color variations found in the characters of _Paranorman_ from Laika Studios:

![image](./images/unnamed_287.jpg)

Muted colors are the opposite of vivid colors, and they are created by simply adding black, white, or grey to a base color.

![image](./images/unnamed_1483.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_188.jpg)

Dull or muted colors like these, refers to colors that have a low saturation or chroma.

![image](./images/unnamed_030.jpg)

By Dermot O' Connor

Other elements to include in color keys (color model sheets) are night-time color schemes, any semi-transparent elements, and what colors can be found in their inner sleeves and under their shoes:

![image](./images/unnamed_326.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_596.jpg)

By William Nichols

#### COLOR BREAKDOWNS

![image](./images/unnamed_624.jpg)

Another aspect a color stylist needs to do is to provide alternate versions of the model (usually close-ups) so that other hard-to-see areas are made more visibly clear. Insides of mouths, insides of sleeves and collars, eyelids, and under shoes/feet, just to name a few examples.

When a whole cast of characters are arranged together, often adjustments need to be made so that the color schemes for each character that are often seen together should compliment each other, and not clash or compete with each other.

![image](./images/unnamed_1198.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_832.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1309.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_943.png)

In 3DCG animated productions, these color designs are used by UV/Texture artists to re-create the surfaces & color shaders for the character models.

There's many types of color schemes you can create, try out a few different kinds for your characters to see what works best, experiment and see which ones match your characters' personalities too.

Color Styling / Color Designing is an integral part of the animation production pipeline.

It's not unusual for color stylists to move into background paint, and maybe eventually to an Art Director role. Everyone's journey is different.

![image](./images/unnamed_1327.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1165.png)

Being observant of the way colors interact in the world around you, and exploring different ways to build out color palettes will sharpen the skills you need to excel as a color stylist.

![image](./images/unnamed_634.jpg)

#### Advice for the Aspiring Color Designer

If you're interested in becoming a color stylist/designer, here are some helpful things to keep in mind for both your personal growth and your portfolio!

1. **Characters and Colors**
   - A strong color design portfolio shows you know how to make clever and appealing color choices.
2. **Embrace the BG**
   - Character color palettes must always exist within a world, having work in your portfolio that includes a background, and shows you know how to color key a character to their world in an appealing way. If you don't have your own BG to use, grab one from anywhere and BLUR it a lot. If you're still not game with that, use a dark gray background, it's better than stark white.
3. **Light and Variation**
   - Another exercise that can both help you hone your skills and showcase them in a portfolio, is doing several color variations of the same design... as well as doing lighting variations to show a character under varying lights (example: warm light, cold light, neon light).
4. **Masks Abound**
   - Less of a thing for a portfolio and more of a skill to practice is utilizing layer masks to cut and color different parts of your character designs and character linework. While each show will have its own style guide, getting familiar with the use of layers and masks can make it easier to transition to designing within a production pipeline. In a TV production, making changes fast and easily is everything so it's important to become acquainted with setting files up in a way that allows you to color shift quickly if needed.
5. **Reference and Style**
   - An important consideration color stylists make is how to choose color schemes that are appropriate for the character in the sense of age, personality, and fashion. Looking up references of different outfits, palettes and clothing sets will help hone your eye for what sorts of colors pair nicely and what the effect of such colors have. Example: More muted, earth tone colors tend to read as "mature" while brighter colors tend to read more youthful, and black.gray may read as edgy/dark. The color of an outfit can radically change the way a character's personality/attitude will be interpreted.

### Mouth Charts

For reference for lip sync animation, designs must be made of the various mouth positions that animators will need for reference. There are many different ways of going about it, typically there's anywhere from 8 to 14 main key positions (for each view) to make.

![image](./images/unnamed_076.gif)

Front, 3/4 Front and Side views are the 3 positions to build mouth charts for.

As with everything, the style of the production will dictate how exaggerated or subtle the changes in the mouth shapes will be, and how far to push mouth shapes and expressions. Also, usually there's a '**happy**' version and a '**sad/angry**' version made for each speaking character, sometimes a third '**neutral**' version as well. For main characters, a front, side, and 3/4 view is made for each set of mouths as well.

![image](./images/unnamed_795.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_718.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_296.jpg)

Even with simple/cartoony mouths, keep the character's anatomy (and graphic style) in mind, think about what range of squash and stretch you may need, what are the limitations, many characters need to talk without teeth as well, many factors need to be considered:

![image](./images/unnamed_1464.png)

These mouth shape guides are usually the last step in the creation of a full character model pack, as you can see, different productions have different codes and slightly different variations on the look for each syllable.

#### Sample mouth charts

![image](./images/unnamed_080.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_508.png)

### Size Comparison Charts

Line up your cast of characters side by side to create a reference chart for every character's scale relative to one and other. This is usually made later on the the design process, once the main/primary characters of the series or film are made. All other characters and props created afterwards, use the one main character as the ruler to visually see the scale for all other designs in comparison. Storyboard artists and Animators will use these charts as reference throughout the production.

### Distance Models

A less common aspect of character design for animation is creating 'distance models'. As the name suggests, these are characters that have been re-designed to have less details so that they are more easily read-able as they are further away in the distance.

Usually only seen in 2D animated series. Simply shrinking down the usual design causes the lines to get mashed together, so new custom-made models for far shots are created, to make a better and more readable design.

Here's a typical **turnaround model sheet**:

![image](./images/unnamed_822.png)

And here's a custom design made for a **Distance Model**:

![image](./images/unnamed_136.png)

So they can be reduced in size and their simplified linework will make the character more recognizable from afar:

![image](./images/unnamed_136.png)

More samples:

![image](./images/unnamed_1429.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_739.jpg)

Here's they are in action:

![image](./images/unnamed_542.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1065.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_654.png)

These models are made for **Wide Shots/Long Shots**, when the subject is far away from the camera.

Not every production uses them, but something to keep in mind.

You can also have 'extra detail' versions of character models for close-ups:

![image](./images/unnamed_1489.png)

### Style Guides

Design Guides, Posing Guides, Drawing Guides, Breakdown Sheets, Construction Models, Style Guides - there's lots of names for them, depending on which department creates them, what group they're for, which studio produces them, and what sort of production they're for. These are becoming more numerous and more frequent in this industry to be made and used, and usually assembled once characters are all completed and finalized. The more time there is in the schedule for them, the more 'DOs & DONTs' and 'How to Draw' guides are drafted from the character designs, art directors and sometimes the showrunners/series directors, to help other artists & animators understand their construction and mechanics.

For example, here are some DOs & DONTs/breakdown sheets made for animators to use as reference for the Devil character from the _Cuphead_ series:

Hand Guides from _Green Eggs and Ham_:

![image](./images/unnamed_1479.png)

Hand models are a unique aspect of character design in 2D animation. They are the one item that is difficult to build a library of assets for, often lots of examples of hand poses are made, but unlike all other body parts hands are usually drawn out by the animator. Pre-made hands can be made available in the build for the character, but animators will need to also custom-make new hands all the time for all the actions, gestures and acting performed by the characters. Therefore as much reference as possible should be made for them to use as a guide for how to draw and pose hands.

Here's the Style Guides from Pickle and Peanut:

![image](./images/unnamed_870.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_819.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1318.jpg)

Sometimes style guides are made to show the rough structure of the characters, for animators to know the three-dimensional construction of the characters, to help them re-draw and pose them with consistent volume, orientation and proportions:

The internet grows exponentially every year, and now more than ever, you'll see old and new design sheets and breakdown sheets like these becoming available.

If the production is more traditionally-animated in style ([hand-drawn][JrWHzXUThg]), then there will be more guides produced on how to draw and pose the characters. If the style is more puppet/cut-out style, then libraries of pre-drawn body parts are made. The animators pick and choose which body part and pose they need. Then stop-motion-style, they move and swap the pieces around frame by frame, therefore much less drawing is required.

### Storytelling in Character Design

An informative essay by [I][xMAGMMIqfX] [ndia Swift and Michael Doig][zrXYzcNBMw]:

Designing characters can be so much more than just creating a \'cool\' or \'appealing\' image. True innovation comes from digging deep into your character\'s personality and their role in your story!

It\'s not too much of an overestimation to say that character design is one of the most sought after positions for freelancers and studio artists. Designing characters all day is an amazing, fun and inventive process that allows for a lot of rough exploration and idea generation, so it\'s no wonder that so many people want to pursue it as a career. To become truly excellent, I believe it\'s important to weave the character\'s central concept/conflict into their visual identity!

I\'m not a professional character designer, but I wanted to talk a little about the way I go about designing my characters and why I do it that way! Hopefully it will help people avoid some of the common pitfalls. Please feel free to share your tips and advice in the comments below, too. I would love to hear your thoughts and techniques!

#### Way Past Cool

The most obvious and common pitfall is designing a character just to look \'cool\'. A character should be designed around a function or personality! Sonic is designed to look cool, sure - but he is also designed to be the fastest thing allliiiiiive! Hence the \'blown back\' spikes (from running so fast, obviously) reminiscent of comic speed lines, his red racing car sneakers, and the endless triangles in his designs!

![image](./images/unnamed_613.png)

You should have known I would use Sonic as an example. I love Sonic. More about shape design later!

His cool attitude is exemplified not only through his design, but through his pose. Getting inventive with the way the character stands or sits, using that to squeeze the most personality into your design you can is key! No more t-posing or facing the camera with hands by your sides.

![image](./images/unnamed_1633.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_594.png)

Have fun with it. How would your character sit, stand, wait, run? All of this is part of the design of the character, not just the job of the animator. When you think about iconic characters like [Bugs Bunny][tdinZPPyHJ], [Superman][pLmveyPLgf], or [Jafar][FKbKEfwjhd], they all have poses that they call to your mind. An important thing to note too is that they are all confident characters. However, the way that this comes through in their posing is very unique to each - they all hold themselves completely differently.

#### Keep it simple

So, a side effect of having no true idea of purpose or function to your character, and of designing them simply to look appealing is festooning your character in stuff that clutters up their design. Needs more belts!

![image](./images/unnamed_019.png)

Try to give any accessories your character has a reason for being there. It could be environmental - maybe if they live in a harsh world, they need to wear/equip some kind of day to day protection. Maybe it\'s something that was given to them and has sentimental value. Maybe it\'s a relic of their past. Maybe it demonstrates their personality. Whatever it is, use it as a way to deepen the world or the character. If it doesn\'t have a function, your character design might be better off without it.

![image](./images/unnamed_1245.png)

Using Midge from my comic [The Girl and the Glim][WetrvGUuMn] as an example, I chose to give her two accessories. One is a friendship bracelet, and one is her brother\'s old hoodie. Midge is a character whose core conflict revolves around the fear that people won\'t like her. The bracelet represents how valuable friendship is to her as well as being an indication of her past, a reminder that moving house means she has left her friends behind. The hoodie is a familiar object that Midge uses to hide herself from others. It helps me a lot when demonstrating her shyness and gives me lots of nice posing options that are unique to her as a character.

> \"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\" \- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

#### Style and Influences

The style you choose to design your characters in will vary depending on the story you are designing them for. Your target audience will also play a big role in these decisions! Setting Stranger Things in the 80\'s had no functionality story-wise. The same story could easily have been told with a modern day setting. However, the creators/designers knew that the story was targeting the generation who grew up on The Goonies and E.T., and wanted to evoke that nostalgia in their audience, and so they chose to set the story within this time period to create the kind of mood and atmosphere they felt would connect with their audience.

![image](./images/unnamed_1138.png)

Each of the styles here communicate something different about the story\'s intent.

The Ghibli style character top left is unlikely to be involved in the same kind of story as the screaming Arin Hanson caricature below her. Likewise the far right Unicorn\'s world will be very different to the bird girl\'s below.

Choosing a style that communicates is important, as establishing audience expectation and then not living up to that promise can cause a knee-jerk reaction from your viewers (though you can also deliberately use it to create twists!). Just as important is being consistent with this style.

A pet peeve I have is when a show or comic will have a lineup of characters, 90% of which are consistent with one another, but then have one design that will completely throw off the aesthetic of the show.

![image](./images/unnamed_1458.jpg)

[A Silent Voice](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Silent_Voice_(film)&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1759597864977746&usg=AOvVaw1ohg0UDwc-zuWFgCFXFLpj>) (2016)

I don\'t have a problem with designs being broad and having more variety in lineups is something I am strongly in favor of. However, if you\'re going to make zanier design choices, you need to sprinkle that throughout your world, rather than having just one character following a different ruleset.

In the above screenshot, Tomohiro the larger character has a head that is disproportionately large and cartoonish compared to the rest of the cast. I think it\'s great that they included a character with a larger body type, but it feels like he is from a different movie. This dissonance kept pulling me out of this fantastic movie, which is a shame. I think they could have pulled his facial design more in line with the rest of the cast to avoid this problem. Also - go and see A Silent Voice if you get the chance, it\'s a wonderful film!

There are times when you might want to break this ruleset deliberately - for example, if you are deliberately making the statement that this character is not of this world, and doesn\'t belong. However in general you should try to keep your style consistent in order to keep your world feeling believable.

### Function and Purpose

Design for Animation Needs:

A further consideration when designing characters is how they will function with the chosen animation style. A character animated with the puppet tool in After Effects will have very different animation needs to one designed for traditional frame-by-frame animation in TV Paint or Harmony.

Think about which character animation style will work for your chosen aesthetic and carefully research what type of world your story is set in. A cartoony, squash-and-stretch animation style may work great for a quirky cast of characters.

![image](./images/unnamed_110.png)

While a more rigid or realistic structure & anatomy will work better for stories holding a bit more gravity, since they're grounded in a less-cartoony, more realistic world.

![image](./images/unnamed_657.png)

> 👉 Conceptualizing Intent: [Jack Burke's Process][NDsCMyuOtQ]

The word 'shape' appears more than 90 times in this document, you will see that it's the most basic element to have and use in all

character design creation.

![image](./images/unnamed_774.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_884.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_432.png)

Designs can range from the **very simple...**

![image](./images/unnamed_754.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_414.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_656.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_537.png)

To the **very complex...**

![image](./images/unnamed_362.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1583.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1477.png)

There's a wide spectrum between simple and complex, characters can vary
from **_realism_** to **_caricature_** and excessive to minimalism - inhabiting many
degrees of diversification and stylization.

![image](./images/unnamed_1130.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_484.png)

The character designs you create will influence how the animation **style of movement** will develop.

This includes the characters' flexibility, mobility, and type of hair & clothing.

There can be a predetermined set of rules and parameters in the style of animation that may influence how you design the characters as well. For example: you may be on a production that won't be able to accommodate for drapery and long flowing capes, cloaks and hair, for either a 2D or 3D production, because these technical limitations could be beyond the scope of the software (or budget), and this would restrict you to creating more tight-fitting clothes and maybe LEGO-style stiff/blocky hair.

Most of the time designers need to research and ask lots of questions and perhaps even see the shooting-style of the storyboards in order to ascertain what limitations there may be in the characters for their restrictions in movements, clothing, hairstyles and range of expressive attitudes. Sometimes there's technical limitations with what the characters can do; Perhaps they must have form-fitting clothes and short hair because it would become too complex to animate long-flowing hair and loose-baggy clothing.

> 👉 The dangers of over-designing your characters are well explained [here][ljdybaRaLN].

#### Simplifying vs Complexity

![image](./images/unnamed_104.jpg)

#### Iconography in Character Design

Digging a bit deeper on the use of images and symbols to represent ideas and how there's a range within the spectrum of all art and illustration when it pertains to realism, stylization, and visual symbolism. Adding symbols, icons, or signs to your character design can add another layer of depth and mystique. This could be giving your character an object that is strongly associated with them, adding [symbolism][iCYTczMpyS] in the character\'s clothing, or including a unique scar or tattoo.

From the _Arcane_ series, see here how they implemented basic symbolism into Jinx and Vi\'s character design:

![image](./images/unnamed_364.png)

These symbols are used as metaphors - imagery that represents their character, visual metaphor is a common tool in film to help convey a story\'s deeper meaning. They can help establish themes, character arcs, and communicate important ideas. They can also help audiences relate to the story and grasp complex ideas more intuitively.

> See this excerpt from Scott McCloud's wonderful book: [Understanding Comics][daTvVvacwd]

[Visual Motifs][FtByyfAbtx] can be depicted in your character design's outfits, or the props they hold, or within the environment they live in. All this can play a part in informing the audience as to their personality and history. Visual development artist Sam Nielson created a reference sheet for these types of representation and their meanings:

![image](./images/unnamed_078.gif)

Downloadable large version [here][HhSTidwRPN].

#### Design for Technical Needs

If the production is using cut-out/puppet-style animation, you'll need to design each part of your character with a mindset in how it will connect and rotate with other body parts. [2D rigging][HOJLeQfbbp], with bone tools and deformers, requires lots of forethought on the interactivity of the body parts and often a trial-and-error process to determine how each body part is connected and what pivot shapes will work best for creating smooth or believable movement, while keeping the rig [functional][VXuXsYxqKr] and easy-to-work with for the animators that pose and operate the characters.

![image](./images/unnamed_011.gif)
![image](./images/unnamed_006.gif)

#### Knowing the Limitations

Being aware of the production's parameters and any specific restrictions involved is important knowledge to have and use in your quest to determine the style. Oftentimes, because the design process can start very early in the production pipeline, there are no clearly defined lists of conditions to be conscious of. At some point, your thought process should be mindful of any constraints in the artistic and technical aspects for the characters' anatomy and physical capabilities. Budgetary concerns and even what software/technology is being used can also be factors to consider.

![image](./images/unnamed_1244.jpg)

For example - the series [Pickle &
Peanut][hRYsVMGjQB] of the characters in Toonboom Harmony could be made practical and functional for animators. The stories and circumstances the characters would find themselves in required them to manipulate, bend, deform, and contort their bodies to meet the needs of the animation style.

A hybrid animation approach was taken for some aspects of the animation (a combination of traditional animation with rigged animation), since their faces and limbs were so flexible and unique in their poses and expressiveness from scene to scene. Therefore a unique production pipeline had to be made: Where the character rigs were customized from scene to scene to meet the demands of the exaggerated and dynamic posing the characters had to do. This way, the models the artists would animate could perform the actions depicted in the storyboards. Very rough storyboards were made and delivered to a team of _character layout artists_, who would use those storyboards as reference and hand-draw/clean-up and add details to the extensive posing/acting of every shot, placing the characters on-model on as they go. Then another team would take these drawn out character [layouts][fYnQIqqPXV] and make customized rigs using the character builds and breaking them, to make the poses match the artwork scene by scene. Then a team of animators would animate the movements from pose to pose using these custom rigs.

If you're designing with no finished scripts in hand, you may only have some rough ideas as to what sorts of stories these characters will find themselves in, this is also common. Getting just a hint of what the characters will need to perform in their scenes by analyzing scripts from the episodic stories will help in the refinement of your designs. Knowing if it's a fast-paced action/adventure series is very different from knowing it's a slow-paced lots-of-talking style series. On feature films the story is constantly evolving through to the very end of production. You simply adapt with the changes from the very beginning as things are developing right until the end of the main production phase as you assist and change designs according to the needs of the production.

The term **function over form** comes from the architectural principle "form follows function," which means that the shape of the building should primarily relate to its intended function. Make-up Design, Set Design and Costume Design all have the same principle. In interior design, _function over form_ means prioritizing how you will use the room or piece of furniture over how it looks. In character design, the same term can be identified when trying to reach a balance between the artistic needs and requirements of your design, versus its practical use for the purpose of the story being told. "Form" is the look of your design, how good, and how cool, and how appealing it looks. "Function" is how practical and usable it is for animation production.

When developing the look and structure of your characters, you must ask yourself: why are you creating this character, what environment are they from or live in, what are the stories and scenarios they will appear in, and who are you creating these characters for; the target audience is something to consider when designing your characters.

> In fine dining, every _second_ counts.
> In animation, every _frame_ counts.
> In character design, every _line_ counts.
>
> - Every line must have a purpose.

Designing how characters will **move** can often be overlooked. The manner in which they move and the mechanics of how they move, how much stretch-ability and flexibility they may have, are all factors to consider. Especially once the demands of the production kick in. Getting to explore and design how movements communicate and enhance character in any Pre _Production Test Animation_ stages can often spotlight some changes in your designs that need to be made. Never forget: your work will be taken by many other artists and they will animate your designs!

_A famous story in animation:_

Bill Melendez, the director of the 1965 TV Special "A Charlie Brown Christmas", had to explain to broadcast executives that the characters in a _Peanuts_ cartoon simply could not hold items 'above their heads' - No matter how much the producers insisted upon it, this wasn't physically possible since their arms were so short and their heads were so big. So _cheats_ and creative solutions always had to be made when staging the action.

![image](./images/unnamed_295.png)

Modern animated series like _Green Eggs & Ham_, _Animaniacs_, and _Central Park_ are just some of many that had traditional model sheets drafted for animators to use as reference, there were NO rigs or Builds created at all for the characters even though they were entirely digitally-produced. Classical frame-by-frame animation methods were used to create every scene in every episode, and it was animated using _Harmony_ software. They were made to look as if drawn traditionally on paper. Tablets and Cintiqs were used to essentially animate in classical methods with entirely digital paperless-animation tools, with very specific custom brushes built for the clean-up animation process for the look of the _final line_.

![image](./images/unnamed_726.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1482.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_829.png)

The more traditionally-animated the characters are, the more beneficial it is to keep the characters simpler in design, this reduces the amount of work for animators must do to make them move. The less lines and textures to animate, the easier it will be to have the characters perform complex actions and acting.

Animation by Mihka Mäntynen

As a character designer you may be asked to create the full cast of main characters for a story. You will eventually need to assemble your designs into a model pack. At first you may only be assisting a lead designer, but if you are in charge of multiple characters and to make an ensemble cast out of them, a model pack is inevitable:

**The Model Pack** refers to the character design sheets for a cast of characters from an animated film or series. A Model Pack attributes to just the characters. While a Main Design Pack (MDP) usually refers to all main characters and key locations/props, that sets the style and tone for the entire series or project.

A [full model pack][BiziSAcLoh] would have the main characters with full turnaround views and poses/expressions sheets + select incidental characters with some various views drawn out for them as well, all contained in a workbook / reference guide as shown [here][uBuTtqcBOU]. Some studios also refer to the term "Fun Packs" - these are usually reserved to being a bundle of bare-essential designs, like main characters and key locations/environments, for the [Storyboard Artist][FICGszhFPc] to use as reference.

In an animated series, Storyboard Artists must often create all sorts of new incidental/secondary and alternative designs that go beyond the initial design pack they were given to use as reference. Therefore, after a storyboard/animatic is done and approved, a _post-board design pass_ is done; A new comprehensive list is made, artists then complete all remaining on-screen design elements that will need to be animated later on, this builds up and finalizes a more complete design pack. Layout Artists and Build Artists/ Riggers use these new designs to complete all remaining assets needed for the animators to have in their scenes to animate with.

A consolidated design pack is made after the storyboards are done, and before [Rigging][HYFOHjdvwm], [Background Layout/Paint][SpVYNiuiQD] and Scene Planning has started.

![image](./images/unnamed_240.png)

In the beginning, the designs you develop and sketch and create are to find out what the characters would look like, and eventually they get [refined][hGFtgtQUwQ] and locked in, and decisions are made as to which design is best suited for the character.

Afterwards, these designs are made to be used as references for all the artists that come **after** you, to use in production. So keep in mind, the more visual information you can offer, the more helpful it will be to the crew that will bring your characters to life.

![image](./images/unnamed_392.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_664.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1510.png)

In some cases, animation tests are made, and the outcome of those tests causes there to be revisions in the designs. Unforeseen limitations or obstacles are discovered in the testing process, leading to adjustments made to the designs and builds in order to make them more functional for animation purposes.

![image](./images/unnamed_087.gif)

If the story requires a character to perform an action that is physically impossible for them to do, then changes to their design may be needed in order for the performance to work, or 'cheats' are made in the poses and builds to accommodate the action to happen.

Cartoon Saloon Animation Tests:

![image](./images/unnamed_024.gif)

See this rigged animation test for _Loud House_, this was not only a way to see what the animation style would look like but also to test the limits of the design and how far poses could be squashed, stretched and exaggerated:

![image](./images/unnamed_057.gif)

### Thoughts on Appeal

Spend enough time talking to animators and you'll start to hear the word 'appeal' come up. In terms of animated characters, appeal is what makes an audience see the character as charismatic, relatable or realistic. It's what makes us feel for them, and remember them, even after the animation is over.

It's imperative to keep in mind the purpose of these characters and their stories, what is the intended audience of the animated work you are designing for, and how your character design will fit within the context of the production.

From simplistic, with a wide range of exaggeration:

![image](./images/unnamed_1018.png)

And simplistic, with a more limited range of expressions and exaggerations:

![image](./images/unnamed_884.png)

To more complex in details, with a wide range of exaggeration:

![image](./images/unnamed_1629.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1347.png)

And complex, with a limited range of exaggeration, with more realistic mechanics of movement:

![image](./images/unnamed_144.png)

Design sheets can offer a wide range of information for several departments in the production.

The art direction, your client's needs, and the requirements of the production will dictate how simplified your character style needs to be. You may want a more artistic look to help your characters stand out from the crowd - this may call for more of a 'broad' character design, or a stylized, abstract, or angular look, maybe a combination of realism and strong graphic qualities.

When presenting a cast of characters, it's often a good idea to show the dynamics of the group.

For example, you could do a standard line-up like this:

![image](./images/unnamed_944.jpg)

Or show more personality, by posing characters like this:

![image](./images/unnamed_491.png)

Depicting better what the show could be in terms of tone and style.

Sometimes when creating characters for a client, they need them for their Pitch Decks and Require the final character designs to presented more like this and less like standard Model sheets where they are only standing up straight with no expressions.

Creating appeal not only comes from the way a character acts and moves, but the very [building blocks][sBpNtPLDgq] of how they are [visually constructed & designed][XgveNnGNrs]. Animated characters come in many different shapes and forms of complexity, from minimal/icon-style all the way up to near-realism.

**Tilt**, **Rhythm**, & **Twist** - Here's tips to use when posing. Former Disney animator Glen Keane coined tilt, rhythm, and twist; if you have a background in studio art or art history, you'll be familiar with the term Contrapposto ("Counter Pose") Tilt and Twist are easy enough to explain: you can get tilt/twist in the head, shoulders, and hips, this will help the pose feel less rigid--you're essentially applying overlapping action to the pose, causing counter-weights or contrast in the postures.

![image](./images/unnamed_1255.png)

Rhythm is a slightly more complex concept. Rhythm is about the flow of your lines and how they lead the eye around the drawing. It's hard to describe in words, hopefully this graphic helps:

![image](./images/unnamed_1306.png)

**Simple vs. Complex** - Rhythm is also tied into the concept of simple vs. complex. You see simple vs. complex in the elements that make up a character, but also in the pose as a whole, and the textures within the character design and scene composition. These contrasts within the pose itself helps to create appeal.

![image](./images/unnamed_1723.png)

Part of achieving **Appeal** in character design is to apply these theories when you can, the root of this comes from the [Solid Drawing Principle][aJwwSupriS] in 2D animation.

- 👉 Watch Mollsie Art talk about the subject of appeal [here][HqbmENUGlx].

![image](./images/unnamed_196.png)

Avoiding Tangents in designs and posing is another factor that helps with appeal:

![image](./images/unnamed_948.png)

Simply overlap or separate shapes and lines, preventing them from merging at the edges.

![image](./images/unnamed_171.png)

You can fix tangents by shifting the line or pushing the line back.

See how the accumulation of many small and subtle changes can add up an overall more appealing design.

Creating appeal in your designs can be the most challenging aspect of the work. There's thousands of variables that all play off of each other. Only with time, countless hours of study & keen observations, with lots and lots of practice, can you build up your instincts to know how to recognize appealing designs and how to create them.

### Anatomy & Structure

The following section is about analyzing the inner-workings and construction of various cartoon character styles, how they are rooted in realistic forms and volumes found in figure-drawing, all from referencing real people and animals. Studying, analyzing, and practicing anatomy can be one of the most challenging and important aspects to learn on your journey to becoming a character designer.

See [here][VwGXjTAyhC] for a guide on the advantages of using more _structural drawing_, from Tracy Butler. Her work is great to sift through, with plenty of tutorials.

![image](./images/unnamed_277.jpg)

#### How to Improve Your Character Form and Structure

One thing to practice as much as possible - Take screenshots from shows, videos, movies you watch and make draw-overs, analyze the structure, figure out what makes it work, break things down, create these studies for yourself to learn how they did it:

![image](./images/unnamed_1301.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_093.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_238.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1092.jpg)

A key part of creating strong character designs is having a strong understanding of form and anatomy. Here are some exercises and tutorials on how to improve these skills:

1. Do many many many anatomy drawing studies.
2. Take a life drawing class in person or online.
3. Practice drawing areas of the body that you find the most difficult - hands, feet, head angles, etc.
4. Visit a zoo or natural history museum and sketch the animals - keep it loose, fast, rough.
5. Go to a park and draw different plants and quick-sketches of people you see.
6. Do lots and lots of [gesture drawings][dKjsnclEDZ], practice the human form.
7. Practice your [proportions][ZEaUAWozAW].
8. Follow the methods from [experts][IUxNUFeHqy].

Rough turnaround and construction guide by Jesse Bechtold:

![image](./images/unnamed_1437.png)

Everything has anatomy and structure, even these designs:

![image](./images/unnamed_811.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_007.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1096.jpg)

Design sheets are often made showing breakdowns and constructions to figure out the mechanics and movements of your character and their range of motion for animators to have as reference, but these are also made to maintain some rules for the solidity and structure of your characters and useful strategies on how to pose them.

![image](./images/unnamed_1282.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_615.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1175.jpg)

![image](./images/unnamed_925.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1576.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_097.png)

To maintain the volume consistency and structure of your character when posing them for their turnaround views and pose sheets, you must analyze and [practice the fundamentals][PaQgnDQNsR] of human (and animal) anatomy. This will give you knowledge on how to simplify and stylize them to accommodate the specific anatomy for the characters you're creating. By doing so, you'll learn how to customize the anatomy for your own characters, to make it fit in the style that is intended.

![image](./images/unnamed_782.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1469.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1001.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_826.png)

These breakdowns are rooted in all forms of structural anatomy and these theories can be adapted to most design styles, but every character has their own unique construction:

#### Figure Drawing

Drawing quick gestures is a great method of practice as it is a significant exercise that can help you fully grasp how to draw a body.

The practice of gesture drawing involves making a quick and simplified sketch of your subject matter (typically a human body).

When [gesture drawing][smGwJICKdU], you are trying to plot down the main elements of the figure in quick and simple linework to capture the general feel of the body and the pose you are trying to communicate.

![image](./images/unnamed_505.png)

This is very helpful in allowing you to get a feel for the flow of the body and how to visually communicate body language, gestures, and poses, in a very simplified manner.

To do gesture drawing, all you really need is a pen and paper, or maybe a drawing tablet or an Apple Pencil and iPad, and some sort of reference.

![image](./images/unnamed_528.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1146.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1652.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1020.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1366.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_606.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_073.png)

This can simply be an online reference image, or if you wanted to try gesture drawing the traditional way, you could use a live model --- maybe even try to find a class to attend.

Then, all that's left to do is start [sketching][RwuRmPQTwe] the body as simply and quickly as you can, ignore specific details, and instead try to draw the flow and linework of the body.

> More about the benefits and techniques of Gesture Drawing [here][LHMRqGopnT].

![image](./images/unnamed_1499.png)

Remember to give yourself a time limit, ranging from 30 minutes to under 30 seconds.

As well as this, don't use an eraser! Just let your pencil flow as you try to capture the essence of the body.

This time limit and lack of eraser will force you to really try and quickly plot down the main elements of the human form, making you more easily grasp any important details and therefore providing you with a better understanding of how to draw a body.

![image](./images/unnamed_1344.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_318.png)

A lifetime can be spent learning, analyzing, practicing sketching the human body.

#### Human Anatomy

Every character you create will have their own unique style of anatomy, the key is to stay consistent within your own style, you will have different body types and body shapes for different characters, but as you create a cast of characters in the world/style you are creating. The more you'll see the range of proportions you will need to do, the more you'll refine the anatomy to match that character's physique and personality.

![image](./images/unnamed_047.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_517.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_041.png)

The body is difficult to capture through art as there are many components to consider. You must remember to engage the [fundamentals][tUAdNiDxIl] of art, specifically considering form, structure, and composition -- as well as considering proportions and figure anatomy, body movements, and stylization. This sort of approach to how your characters are constructed from the inside out, takes time to develop, like any illustration skills, there's several ways to mold and shape your characters, and every style has their own brand of [anatomy][vMtkBrqztu].

There's a wide range of anatomy styles to pick from and to create yourself.

Hands, in general, can be the most diverse and complex things to pose and the most difficult to master.

There's many lessons [online][ytVOzkPKxN] to help you improve.

When you're doing more human anatomy based in realism, there are different factors to consider, compared to when you do more flat/graphic/cartoony styles.

![image](./images/unnamed_882.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1071.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1215.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_805.jpg)

Before you can begin adding personality and stylization to the bodies you draw, it is integral to understand the proportions of human anatomy. Getting the body proportionally correct can be difficult, but there are a few shape-work techniques you can use to sketch the human body as shown in the samples above and below. Practice drawing your [forms in poses][wvBeUDKyNK] that demand a challenging perspective.

![image](./images/unnamed_380.png)

Drawing a body is a difficult task, especially because there are so many different components to consider. Trying to create an [anatomically correct figure][HczDszGlDA] is not always easy. The body is integral to many aspects of design; you need it for any character you might want to create or even in environmental artworks with people in the background.

So studying and practicing how to draw a body is important. You want to feel comfortable creating stylized figures in whatever poses and designs you would like.

#### Animals/Creatures

How to breakdown and learn from the references you save & compile...

Here's a post from the amazing, [HelpfulHarry][KPcKcvPwBK]:

> **So let\'s make Bad Art of a Deer because I happen to have one handy**.

Start with a photo of your subject in a nice/neutral pose with all four feet visible (so not like me).

![image](./images/unnamed_1132.png)

Freehand copy it. Try not to stylize, focusing instead of matching proportions and pose. Don\'t get too detailed!

![image](./images/unnamed_1465.png)

Either _lasso + distort_ or redraw a copy of your first sketch with your reference behind it (scaled to match the main body of your sketch).

Put the original and modified sketches together and compare the differences. Write it down if you want. This shows you where your eyes saw things the wrong size, so you can correct for that next time.

![image](./images/unnamed_699.png)

It\'s ok if your art looks terrible and has broken legs. I\'ve drawn LOTS of deer so I have a leg up. Everyone\'s art sucks in their own eyes and here\'s where mine went wrong: [Video][cbzhFGEWUm]

After learning about both deer and yourself, try freehand copying again.

![image](./images/unnamed_220.png)

Marvel at your newfound knowledge and skill!

But there\'s always room for improvement...

![image](./images/unnamed_1688.png)

You can stop here and move on to your real drawing, Or do another freehand-fix-compare cycle. I actually overcorrected my \"draws heads too big\" and veered into \"heads too small.\"

![image](./images/unnamed_424.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_402.png)

Another note on tracing: Learning HOW to trace is more important than anything you could learn by tracing. Draw the Anatomy, not the outline. In real life, things don\'t have outlines, they have bones.

![image](./images/unnamed_506.png)

These are from the same shoot which is extra useful for consistency. The lines are minimal and follow where the animal\'s joints are, and only important parts are drawn.

You won\'t know what Important Parts means right off the bat, which is where in-depth study comes in. You need to do this over and over, to learn the hard parts, to do the easy parts right.

##### How to study Bones and Muscles

- \"Study the anatomy"
- "Study the anatomy\"
- But they never tell you HOW.

It\'s not \"read a book,\" It\'s more like flailing around wildly and crashing your browser from too many tabs.

This is all about How to **make** a bones and muscle chart. Because even if your art sucks, you learn so much more by doing than by seeing, finding skeletal and muscle anatomy references online. Get set up. Get photos, like below, but it doesn\'t have to be the same photos. And now\... **gather and organize references.**

![image](./images/unnamed_181.png)

References I gathered:

- [Refrence 01][csrNLaIDoZ]
- [Refrence 02][OjkZaBdyRm]
- [Refrence 03][rwGYNKXeVR]
- [Refrence 04][WoUziRsVQs]
- [Refrence 05][qEnSQkbWSB]
- [Refrence 06][DVavSBySXW]
- [Refrence 07][TQaZBuVSTk]
- [Refrence 08][CWuGDfxaEB]

We\'ll start with bones. Search up \"\[animal\] skeleton\" and get photos or super scientific illustrations. Add in things like \"top view\" to spice it up.

Next, search \"\[animal\] skeleton sketchfab.\" This pulls up 3D models that you can rotate in your browser. Remember that these are art and the anatomy is only as good as the artist, so pick a good one.

![image](./images/unnamed_205.png)

Time for bone!

The spine is the most important, and in a lot of animals it will surprise you. Draw it in over your photo and then add spikes because skeletons are punk. These are not scientific and I didn\'t count them because their number doesn\'t matter to art. So you better be referencing scientists and not me!

![image](./images/unnamed_611.png)

The rest of the bones and some notes. These are my notes to _myself_ about things I want to remember. My personal discoveries in anatomy that made my art better. You can make the same notes but also make sure you have your own thoughts on there as well. That\'s how you help yourself the best. Be as detailed or vague as you want.

![image](./images/unnamed_991.png)

Same deal with muscle. Here are my personal notes to myself. Label stuff that is important to you. I actually grouped a bunch of muscles together based on what is visible from the outside. Muscles are way more complicated than this, but Baby\'s First Anatomy Chart gets to be simple.

![image](./images/unnamed_1158.png)

This is good enough for me because I have intimate knowledge of the other muscles working under and over these ones. Feel free to add as many or as few muscles as you like. You chart your own course.

This is very VERY much not an anatomical chart. I\'m sure there\'s nerds out there pulling their hair out looking at this. But listen, it works for art!

![image](./images/unnamed_1572.png)

And you know the wildest part about this?

I don\'t need to look at it to use it. The act of making your own anatomy chart puts that knowledge in your brain. Like how you can make \"cheat sheets\" even for tests that don\'t allow them - the act of making the sheet helps you remember what you struggle with most.

And after all that complexity? Your simplification will be based on Real Knowledge and you\'ll put those random circles in the right spots.

![image](./images/unnamed_1390.png)

Look at all this hard work you\'ve done. Eventually this will be second nature to you.

And you can apply this TO ALL HUMAN AND ANIMAL ANATOMY - your skill levels will advance VERY quickly the more you do these types of breakdowns and analysis.

Learning animal anatomy helps you in your animal-related designs. Exploring styles for animal and creature designs should be practiced, here are some sample sketches of various animal and anthropomorphic characters:

#### Boost your Design IQ

Knowing the fundamentals, and only the fundamentals, very very well, gives you the solid foundation you need to approach any design style with confidence. Here's some exercises, some are very simple, others are more demanding. Giving yourself more and more [exercises][vLYcuAByVG] that repeat the fundamentals in new and challenging ways will improve your draftsmanship.

Explore the [Iterative Drawing Method][aupfRcwaXZ] to improve your draftsmanship.

There's many examples of people learning and improving through [repetition][XnSIzSdPin].

Some advice on your state-of-mind when it comes to producing art from [Greg Broadmore][JBGgZnEPAc].

##### Back to basics

The following exercise will improve your hand dexterity and ability to efficiently [draw the forms][kgOZJMpgIC] you need to construct anatomy by sketching circles, ellipses and other shapes while also getting you into the mental state of calmness needed to start work on a real drawing, here's a breakdown:

![Image of circles and ellipses](./images/unnamed_1431.png)

You should practice filling a page or digital canvas everyday with circles, it's great for motor skills and to get you hand to sketch these out fast and with confidence.

Avoid this:

![Macintosh HD:Users:ron:Downloads:circlesnoooo.png](./images/unnamed_1672.png)

It needs to look more like this:

![image](./images/unnamed_1466.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_963.jpg)

Practicing drawing [cylinders][kFZbdUnWWT] is a good way to warm up and is a surprisingly useful way to get perspective sketched out freehand.

![image](./images/unnamed_616.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1016.png)

Cylinders are quite versatile. You'll often end up in a situation where it is useful to be able to draw them quickly and accurately. For example, it is helpful to approximate arms and any limbs [foreshortening][hraKBfasyU] through cylinders when drawing the human form.

![image](./images/unnamed_558.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1113.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1540.png)

You can also deform cylinders into organic shapes.

![image](./images/unnamed_576.png)

It's just useful to be able to freehand cylinders! And it is a great drawing exercise when you have no reference to work from or no inspiration. Become better at drawing by doodling circles, ellipses, cylinders and cubes. All character designs can be constructed with these [forms][lFQTMnXkff].

![image](./images/unnamed_470.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_593.png)

##### TIME TO DRAW CUBES

![image](./images/unnamed_745.jpg)

Practicing these fundamentals as warm-up exercises is a great way to get the motor skills running before you start any new design task. There's no better way than doing lots and lots of lines, circles, ellipses, cylinders, boxes and cubes, here's an expanded version:

#### Analytical Sketching

![image](./images/unnamed_406.png)

Applying all the techniques shown above to analytic drawing will have you practicing constructs with 2D projections of 3D shapes to create the structure of your forms, allowing you to visually rough out any subject into its basic shapes and depict it with proper perspective from any angle.

### Stylization

This can be a very subjective thing to define. How much 'style' should you put into your design? What is 'style'? And where do you start on this broad spectrum?

> _"Often your limitations dictate a lot of your stylistic and creative choices, and I think that's OK, as long as you have an interesting concept to work from." - Drew Daniels, Cinematographer_.

This involves you finding your specific and individual style of drawing, and sticking to it consistently throughout your artwork. In a broader sense, the stylization process and the stylizing of character designs can encompass the countless ways of creating art, and everyone will find their own style through practice. It\'s all about how to make these drawings and designs feel like your own, and for each new production and concept you dive into, you find the style that best serves the character personalities, and the world and scenarios they will find themselves in.

![image](./images/unnamed_540.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_386.png)

How much style is too much style? Everyone has their own preference and opinion, and many factors are involved in the defining of **style**, and how far to push the stylization of something and how much detail to add or subtract. Many decisions are made on how much exaggeration should be injected or removed from the designs.

Here are designs by Ana Piedrafita for the Pocoyo series:

![image](./images/unnamed_022.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_642.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_603.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_822.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1178.jpg)

Simplicity and cuteness is obviously the goal for these designs.

![image](./images/unnamed_023.jpg)

Of course, ascetic minimalism itself holds little meaning. Context imbues significance. The process of simplifying designs and the art of reducing the amount of details often expresses more with less. Restrictions hone communication to indispensable signals, the easier and faster a designer is recognized, the more successful your character model will be. At the intersection of restraint and intent, very simple designs with basic shapes and forms uplifts truth and beauty: [Keep it Simple][WnLsqXrytX]

Examples of Bold Exaggerations:

- **Johnny Bravo** -- Crazy hairdo, bulging pecs, and arrogance exaggerated for laughs
- **Adventure Time** -- Friends frolicking through surreal candy-filled worlds
- **Samurai Jack** -- Jagged lightning style pushed into epic presentation
- **Borderlands** -- Dark humor and visual edge match its absurdity

Johnny Bravo turnaround model:

Pioneers of low-poly / pixel art / 8-bit styles:

- **Minecraft** -- LEGO-like blocks empower creative construction
- **Re-Volt** -- Toy RC cars gain tactile charm
- **Voxatron** -- Voxel retro effects evoke gaming's dawn
- **Habbo Hotel** -- Minimized avatars enable diverse expression
- **Thomas Was Alone** -- Geometric shapes brimming with personality
- **Super Mario / Megaman / Link from Legend of Zelda** -- Nintendo mascots

![image](./images/unnamed_244.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_828.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1462.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_581.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1341.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_904.png)

Simple geometric models tap a nostalgia vein through their blocky charm. Low poly art employs hard edges and elemental shapes rather than pursuing endless detail. Less complexity focuses attention on possibilities over realities.

Abstract shapes leave space for imagination to fill the gaps. Our minds complete the visions through personalized perceptions. Low poly models guide eyes through implied motions along crisp vector paths. By finding virtue in technological limits and distortion, low poly art spotlights stirring essence below surface elaboration.

![image](./images/unnamed_913.png)

All styles contain strengths to amplify their personalities and stories. Photorealism conveys humanity, cartooning enables humor, and low poly maximizes minimalism. Wise character creators mix and match sensibly by considering impacts on emotion, branding, and performance. Most importantly, they pour passion into every line and pixel. That personal touch makes all the difference.

![image](./images/unnamed_1439.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_781.jpg)

Highly stylized art similarly cranks up reality through visual hyperbole. Every element gets exaggerated just shy of breaking believability, amplifying the stories they're into operatic spectacles. Super-exaggerated anatomy heightens the humor. By escaping the shackles of realism, artists can bend the medium to meet the vision. Costumes morph into über-symbolic power fantasies. Weapons swell to outrageous proportions mirroring their warrior's outsized strength. Highly distorted bodies become human ideograms. Backdrops warp surreally to externalize psychological subtexts. Realism depicts what is; stylization reveals what could be.

But the most effective exaggeration remains anchored to humanity. [Caricatures][uIMsHQvRkM] work best when we perceive the real person peering through the warped/simplified/exaggerated version you see. Unique character art style choices should align with and amplify authentic traits rather than pile on arbitrarily. Like a bungee cord, the most elastic visions snap back to their origins.

![image](./images/unnamed_1699.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_335.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_280.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_732.jpg)

Preferences in stylization and appeal can be a subjective topic of discussion, it's all about how much to simplify, or not simplify, how representative to real-life people, animals, and objects it needs to be, and how far can the exaggeration be pushed.

A term you might hear a director or client say: "_Push the style_".

It may seem like an arbitrary statement, but it's usually referring to revising/improving the design in a way that further exaggerates the aspects and elements that give the artwork its unique appearance. If the eyes are proportionally quite big, make them bigger. If the hands are small, make them smaller. If the character is quite square and blocky, make them more so. If the characters seem very flat and rigid, make them more so. If they are very squashy and gooey, then make them more so. If the characters have long skinny limbs, make them more so.

Pushing styles is about finding out how far is too far - if the eyes are small, make them extra small. If they have big hair, make them extra big. If they have long skinny limbs, snake them extra long. If they have tiny hands, make them extra tiny. If they have thick feet, make them extra thick.

Pushing style levels is always fun, as you can see from these examples, shapes and proportions and scale are the main factors that can have anyone experiment with how to stylize your designs more or less, it's boundless the range you can explore.

![image](./images/unnamed_277.png)

Discovering what the limitations are within the particular designs you are creating is part of the process. Developing the structure, design logic, and anatomy of your character's style can be a journey in itself:

There can be a vast spectrum to consider when finding the style you're looking for. Most times, people don't know what style they want to see, or create, until they've seen it. But usually offering a range of realistic to cartoony, covers a spectrum of possibilities to begin narrowing down the **style** a client (or you) may be looking for.

![image](./images/unnamed_1154.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_855.png)

One method you can use to find your style is to test out different ways of drawing a body until you find something that works for you, adapting it until it becomes your own. For methods and inspiration for drawing stylized anatomy specifically, see [this][pZCPieqmDS] and [this][rarLWMRsDF].

Experiment with linework; try different sketching styles, like using harsh confident linework or smooth-flowing lines.

Because styles are so limitless, there are so many methods you can use to learn how to stylize your body.

![image](./images/unnamed_1639.png)

Staying consistent within your own style can take a long time to figure out and accomplish, the secret to fostering and developing this with yourself is through lots and lots and lots of drawing, it's the only way to discover how YOU can draw your own thing, in your own way, and explore and fine-tune how YOU would handle any type of character. Observe the works of [Mike Mignola][JFnSXjfBzD], part of the appeal of his art style in how consistent he is within his own style.

![image](./images/unnamed_1379.png)

Remember that the term for "style" in character design for animation can refer to a few different things:

It can refer to a specific **person** who originated a certain look, like [Matt Greoning][vKaPXwXpzi] (seen in shows like Simpsons, Futurama, and Disenchantment) or [Norman Rockwell][xanshgjOrg] (seen in American commercial illustrations from the 1940s and 50s).

It can refer to a **property**, like [Scott Pilgrim][MPzGwmnMqr] (created by Bryan Lee O\'Malley) or [Adventure Time][hafRZFGJNX] (initially created by Pendleton Ward, then many others refined, expanded and continued the style).

It can refer to a **time period**, like the [1930s][uzpgCDjOLC] (as emulated in the animated series and video game Cuphead, which was derived from the very early works of Disney/Warner Bros/Fleischer).

It can refer to a **studio**, like [Aardman][XsrIRGJlXT] (as seen in the Wallace and Gromit films), or [UPA Studios][KIqMDArfrH] cartoons from the 1950s, or [Studio Ghibli][TVJhAmManR] (as seen in many works of Hayao Miyazaki), or both a studio and a certain time period, like [Hanna-Barbera][mGwVidcber] (as seen in many 1960s and 1970s animated series).

With many other combinations of these categories as well.

![image](./images/unnamed_341.png)

For studios in particular - it's referred to as '_the house style_' when a specific studio has a very particular and consistent look to all their designs for all their productions. _Old Disney_, compared to _Modern Disney_, same as _Klasky Csupo_, _Pixar_, _Don Bluth_, _Filmation_, _Nelvana_, _Aardman_ or _Ghibli_, they all have their own distinct, consistent, and long-running visual styles (especially in their early years) that they are most known for. Other more modern animation companies like _Studio Cachette_, _The Line_, _Madhouse_, _Laika_, and _Screen Novelties_ all have fairly unique and distinct house styles seen in most of their work. Though the art direction may vary from production to production, they seem to have a signature "look" to all the shows and films they've made.

Study various graphic styles from art history and architecture too, you never know when you'll need to borrow ideas from [Neo Expressionism][DZlmgDzkGk], [Brutalism][oOgfYLZThj], [Art Deco][cfUIeKVHrV], or [Cubism][KlgVxGEfBN].

There can be lots to learn from the old comic book ways too, including the criss-crossing spectrum between Realism vs Exaggeration and Low Detail vs High Detail.

- See [here][RxZZxTLIVN] for some insight on these various styles and methods.
- See [here][FadghXnqvX] for Scott MacCloud's breakdown from the world of sequential art.

There's hundreds of different combinations of styles to draw inspiration from.

There's over 100 years of character design history to become familiar with. Every few years we see trends change, tastes change, and new talent gets injected into the industry with new and fresh ideas. Often old styles tend to resurface and get re-imagined, and as new designers discover and rediscover old art styles, they often get remixed into the new modern styles we see today.

![image](./images/unnamed_247.png)

For example, looking back at the designs from the **80s** and **90s**, the characters are more realistic and in a way, have many similar looks and traits, comparable to the comic books of that era. But going into the **2000s** and **2010s**, many shows began to have a wider range of shapes and silhouettes for character design styles, borrowing aspects from the **50s** and **60s**:

![80s-90s kids be like "all CN shows look the same these days" :CartoonNetwork](./images/unnamed_343.jpg)

Trends, visual preferences, and styles seem to change and evolve every few years, then old trends circle back around and become popular again.

![image](./images/unnamed_592.jpg)

A **stylized character**, in general, is a character that has its proportions deformed and exaggerated in some ways to create a magnified character - made out to have a softer/cuter look, or just a super-simplified version of what would be a realistic character as well. Other ways to "push the style" is to overemphasize certain physical attributes, if the character is blocky and angular - make them more so, if the character is bubbly and cute make them more so. There are many ways to approach how you want your character to look.

Sylvain Chomet

You can try creating a Chibi version (a term derived from Japan), or a stylized character similar to those seen in contemporary animated movies.

![image](./images/unnamed_1370.png)

The main distinction between them lies in the level of deformation these characters undergo. Chibis, originating from already stylized characters in manga or anime, exhibit significant deformations.

Currently, these types of characters find use in several applications, primarily in animated series or video games. Their visually appealing aesthetics easily capture the attention of younger audiences, but their charming appearance also attracts adults.

![image](./images/unnamed_646.png)

Typical Chibi Style:

![image](./images/unnamed_1516.png)

However, there are numerous ways to create highly-stylized characters, making them one of the most challenging aspects to achieve, in both 2D and 3D/CGI. They can also be used ironically for a [cute][oNyTkTqYuK] or humorous effect.

​​![image](./images/unnamed_1044.png)

When it comes to proportions, stylized characters share common characteristics - the process can be divided into three parts: head, body, face. Depending on the proportions you choose, you can achieve a more realistic impression similar to Fortnite or a more cartoonish character.

- **Head:** the bigger the better. The head, along with the face, is the most crucial aspect of these models. Not only do you need to enlarge the head, but you should also make it rounder to give the character a softer appearance. If there are special features on the head that are characteristic of the character, such as scars or wrinkles, include them, but exaggerate their appearance.
- **Face:** the face, together with the head, is one of the most important parts. The face should be proportionate with the head, so maintain balance in their proportions. Pay special attention to the eyes, making them rounder and larger than the other facial features. Even if you are aiming for a more realistic proportions, consider enlarging the eyes slightly to enhance expressiveness.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_622.png)
- **Body:** in contrast to the head, the body tends to lose its shape and become smaller, often as small as two and a half heads. Additionally, the body tends to lose its landmarks on the muscles. To create the desired shape, you will need to exaggerate the basic forms of the body. For instance, you can use a triangular shape to emphasize a muscular body or a rectangular shape to create an slender body.

Compare the 2003 version with the 2013 redesign of Teen Titans:

![image](./images/unnamed_395.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_149.jpg)

As a general rule; try to use a small color palette, ideally with no more than five main colors. This will help you focus on your artistic goals.

Mastering stylized art requires a thoughtful blend of proportion and a limited yet impactful color scheme for charming character design. With these small tips, hopefully, you can start designing your own characters.

![image](./images/unnamed_644.png)

Always remember, the devil lies in the details.

As you continue to practice and refine your skills, you\'ll discover your unique style and approach to character design.

Don't forget, every artist has their own journey, and every character you create is a step on your path of artistic discovery and growth.

### What is Art Direction?

It is the LOOK of your production. Design, Color, Lighting, Shapes, Textures - many elements are involved. Art direction can be a broad term depending on which industry and what types of productions you're referring to, but this usually pertains to the design **style** of the [backgrounds][LDOpQgisiz] (locations / sets / environments / scenery) for an animated production. However, in a broader sense, it also includes the [character][jtjcTVMHPE] art style as well, which also consists of clothing, props & FX, and how well they all work together - for the overall look and visual aesthetics of the entire production. As a result, lots of research and development is made to find the right look.

![image](./images/unnamed_1097.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1166.jpg)

These are important factors to know since character design does affect other aspects of the design process on a production. Usually many levels of communication between various artists is needed for creating all aspects of the characters, props, and backgrounds. Keeping everything consistent while meeting the production's demands can be challenging. Be aware that as a character designer, you may have a _Design Supervisor_ or _Character Supervisor_ or _Art Director_ as your manager/department lead.

The title of **Art Director** and **Production Designer** are often interchangeable. Sometimes they can be a solitary artist working on concept designs and visual development alone, or they can be the lead on a team of designers and held responsible for keeping consistency and cohesiveness through the many departments and stages of the design process.

The duties may vary from production to production and studio to studio, but Art Directors are usually responsible for all aspects of the visual style of the animated film or series. On big productions, there can be an art director for each department - bringing to life the production designer's vision and style. They decide how the characters, props and environments are going to look and provide a basis for the rest of the design department to work from.

- **Art Directors on a 3DCG animated film**
- **Overall Vision:** The Art Director sets the overall style and aesthetic of the film, ensuring it aligns with the director\'s vision and story.
- **Collaboration:** They work closely with the director, production designer, and other artists to guide the creative process.
- **Creative Leadership:** They provide direction, feedback, and guidance to the art team, ensuring the film\'s visual elements are cohesive and impactful.

For example, you can have cartoony-looking characters within hyper-realistic environments like [here][PLiKmnPBJi] and [here][vwRbhPDAVf], or semi-realistic characters with highly-stylized or abstract backgrounds like [here][rELFjBeSBj]. The art direction of any animated production can be a very wide spectrum of visual possibilities.

Art directors start by examining the script or story premise and working with the director and any lead production designers to understand the vision for the film or series. Then they create concept designs and determine the tone, mood, and color palettes of the story.

In animated feature films - Art directors can also be known as CG Supervisors, VFX Supervisors, and Production Designers.

Concept art is the earliest exploration for finding the look of the production and to create visual ideas for everyone to see and comment on and this work is often used as part of a pitch to sell the project, film or series, before production is fully underway. The work of an art director is more specific and directive than the work of a concept artist or visual development artist.

![image](./images/unnamed_901.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_322.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_601.jpg)

Concept artists are usually freelancers, they come in, bang out a few sketches or color concepts and out they go, and they are the first to draw the exploration sketches for the production. Sometimes when a concept artist's work becomes the style that the production is targeting to be what they are going for (whether it be for environments or characters) then they stick around for longer. Since their art is the template that all other designs will be based off of. Usually a few different concept artists are brought in, so they can do a scatter shot of possible visual styles for the creative leads to use as reference. This way they can see which artistic direction they would rather go with. Their artwork is then used as a "look target" for background and character designers further down the line.

In these very early stages, they produce artwork and collaborate with the studio and directors to find a visual style that works. It's important that they communicate well with the client (creator/producer) to understand what is needed. They will often have to go back and redo their designs several times before they find something the studio/client is happy with. Sometimes the first passes are quick and loose for faster results and feedback. Other times, they add more detail and quality. They use computer software as well as hand-drawing and painting to create their art.

Sometimes _concept boards_ or reference boards are made, where lots of images are gathered as an initial inspiration pack by the visual development artist to see if they're going in the proper direction. Before committing to sketches, these style boards can cover color palettes, costuming, and hairstyles of all sorts. They can also be made by the art director or creative producers to give to the concept artists and designers, to guide them in the general direction they need to go.

![image](./images/unnamed_140.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_186.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_639.png)

These can also be called mood boards, image boards or aesthetic boards; when it's a big job, they are the best place to start before you begin working on your characters/story. It'll be where you lay out the inspiration for your character as a whole, from their personality and traits to what they wear and how they look. Think of it like a collage of ideas for who your character is. It's a chance for you to brainstorm and gather your thoughts before diving into the writing or drawing part of your project.

Art directors determine the '_design language_' of the film, which requires them to have an understanding of what the final, on-screen image will look like and how to get there. They work with the concept artists to develop sketches and artwork that communicate the artistic vision to the rest of the crew. In big-budget feature films, the Production Designer tends to be the one to give the consistent and singular LOOK for the visual style of the world, and the team of Art Directors supervise the many departments at every stage, to execute that vision into realization.

Associated with Art Direction is the process of [Look Development][mltUKiSBHJ] - it's the stage in most 3D/CG animated productions that builds the world and characters by creating the colors, textures, and materials for everything you see in the final rendered images. Look Development also explores how to actually achieve the intended visual look, pursuing the technical side of taking the concept art and discovering the process needed to practically attain and achieve the **look** for the actual production.

In many 3D/CG feature films, Art Directors are involved throughout the entire project, up to its release, acting as a supervisor to the other artists, such as modelers, character designers and environment designers. This is a job that involves a lot of communication with people and needs strong management skills. They are responsible for ensuring all artwork is of a high quality and in keeping with the director's vision. They are also responsible for making sure everyone in the art department stays on budget and on schedule. Art directors are sometimes employed as freelancers working on a project by project basis. Art Direction usually splits into two main categories - **Environments** (also known as: Sets / Backgrounds / Locations) and **Characters**.

#### Environment Art Direction

For animated feature films, hundreds upon hundreds of sketches & color concepts are drawn and painted in order to explore and later refine the final look of the characters and settings found in the movie.

In a 2D animated series - Character Design is a portion of the **_Production Design_** phase of animation (which can also include Environment & Background Design, FX Design and Prop Design), which is all part of the **_Pre-Production_** process, where scripts, voices, visual development, and story art are also produced.

To observe the differences in **Location Designs** versus **Character Designs** for animated films, see the works of Sylvain Marc as he presents his concept designs for locations on [Hotel Transylvania 2][lTsGUxUHTI], and then his concept designs for characters on [Boxtrolls][uKOoVNamTb].

It's not too often the same artist can contribute to both these areas of art direction in such a major way, usually production designers specialize in either Characters or Locations, not often both.

More info about all this in great detail here:

### Prop Design

A quick note about prop designs - Most of the time prop designs are made by a separate artist from the design department, there are times where a character designer may be asked to help design props as well. Items like any hand-held objects or vehicles and any item the characters interact with, that are separate from the background or environment are known as 'props'. It's important to cover prop design here since they are unavoidably linked to character design.

Just like characters, props need to be designed from various views and angles:

![image](./images/unnamed_037.jpg)

By Alexis May Lambert

For Mobile Games, Prop Designers and BG Designers often share the same tasks as props and various items found in the environment become part of the backgrounds, whether they have animated aspects to them or not:

![image](./images/unnamed_081.png)

It's common to extract elements from background designs and construct these as their own self-contained item with turnaround views as well, depending on the art director, sometimes props are designed out of the background concepts and sometimes background artists borrow from the prop designs first to incorporate the item in the scenery. Sometimes both background designs and prop designs use the storyboards for reference, other times the designs need to be worked out in detail first, so that the storyboard artists use them as reference and then it gets carried through to final design in the animation scene setup process.

![image](./images/unnamed_589.png)

Prop designers have very similar skill sets to character designers and background designers, usually with a strong sense of [perspective drawing][ZoiCCFukxu] and structural drawing, with the ability to sketch complex objects in various three-dimensional views and angles.

Just like characters, prop designs are created in a certain visual style, usually matching the graphic art style of the backgrounds/environments. Sometimes they match more closely to the character art style, especially if the backgrounds are very different from the characters' aesthetics. But they are objects needing to be designed at various angles since they are meant to be animated. For example, [Lilo & Stitch](<https://people.com/thmb/OuqC8cHTbN8OTu7c-ThAiPDn0Hk%3D/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x449:901x451)/lilo-and-stich-42716eea64ad4d16a01c76f8c1ec30c3.jpg&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1759597865156848&usg=AOvVaw22DPffkITsT78w84zLBOb2>) has watercolor-style painted backgrounds, so the prop designs needed to look like they could easily fit within the environments, but still match the characters' overall art style, for when they're interacting with them. Sometimes the props would be watercolor-style, sometimes they would be cel-painted with flat colors when needing to be animated.

👉 Shape language, perspective & structure plays a major part in constructing prop models:

- [Exemple 1][cTLFqMeiaq]
- [Exemple 2][wYWAknAqdI]

Explorations sketches are made to rough out concepts before refining them into final designs:

![image](./images/unnamed_572.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1588.png)

Grouping thumbnail roughs together to see how they will work when they're all in one location is common exercise too:

![image](./images/unnamed_724.png)

Rotations are illustrated for props that will be seen and used a lot:

![image](./images/unnamed_1611.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1532.png)

Size comparisons are usually needed by having a faded version of the main character on display for size relationship, especially for props and items that are being handled and used by characters:

![image](./images/unnamed_1356.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_587.jpg)

Just like for character models, various views and angles are illustrated:

Prop designs follow the same visual language as any character and background design:

![image](./images/unnamed_535.jpg)

Props can also be attached to backgrounds, a common example are doors, they are first designed by background artists, but then handled as prop designs once they need to be animated to rotate and be shown at many angles, and being handled by the characters as well. A car parked in the background will only need to be designed from that one angle, but once a character steps inside and begins to drive it around, it will need to be properly designed and built with many angles and views, both the interior and exterior.

Entire buildings can be considered as props, whether or not they are animated (2D or 3D), even if they are levitating around by magic, and not turning or rotating, they still become an object needing to be moved around, therefore they become props.

Just like character or background designs, props are subject to rough sketching during the conceptual stages as well.

Color concepts and color models are made in the same way as characters, you start off as roughs, then clean lines, then color.

![image](./images/unnamed_1007.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_712.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_376.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_627.jpg)

It's common for Prop Designers to create their own colors, they may have guidance from the Art Director or need to use background designs or character designs for color reference.

![image](./images/unnamed_768.jpg)

There can be some visual symbolism and **personification** involved in prop design:

This is the attribution of a personal nature or human characteristics to something [nonhuman][gEvjFUGdzx], or the representation of an abstract quality in human form. Like a tree designed with its branches resembling long arms reaching out, or simply adding a tiny face or an eye on a prop design, all these can add a quality of personality to the object. Examples found in creative writing: "The sun smiled down on us."

"The story jumped off the page."

"The light danced on the surface of the water."

Examples of this could be: a backpack being designed to look old, saggy, weathered and beaten up, to match the state-of-mind of its owner, or to show what hardships this backpack has undergone. A mirror designed to look monstrous and evil because it holds a magical creature inside. You can always subvert expectations by having a sweet, cute, innocent-looking object actually be used by someone dark and sinister for a certain effect. Imagine what an enchanted key would look like if it was designed to be linked to an all-seeing entity.

![image](./images/unnamed_393.png)

In novel writing and scriptwriting, personifying an object means to figuratively describe it with human traits in order to craft a vivid image of that object in your reader's mind. But to interpret it in illustration and animation would be to visually depict it so that it is instantly recognizable; to subconsciously have the viewer identify it with a personality type or behavior. The simple act of making a prop look old, worn out and drooping, versus making it look fresh, young, new, clean, perky and firm - can drastically change the feeling of how the design will be perceived and what history may lie in that prop's narrative and purpose.

![image](./images/unnamed_151.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_012.png)

Principles of appeal, structure, and contrasting shapes also apply to prop design, even the most simple objects:

Just like for characters, research is often necessary to do. For example, something as simple as _old fashion forks_, could have you researching the [history of silverware][SEUzVaBVwt] to help in your inspiration.

There are sites like [hum3d.com][QemKDESSkj] that are great for searching up and observing hundreds of objects, props, vehicles and anything else of this nature at various angles, for drawing reference.

Gathering photo references to help in the design process is important to the exploration and discovery part of your early concept art and rough sketching. For example, let's say you need to design an item for an _alchemist's portable toolbag_. Items to search up would be a portable tackle box or tool bag (adding old or vintage in your search) - begin sketching with a wide range of research images and see what items you can combine together:

![image](./images/unnamed_373.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_815.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1270.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1626.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_559.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_191.png)

Sometimes props can become very complex, as a single item may need to be illustrated from many different views and angles, and may have to be opened up to reveal its interior. Vehicles are often the case, as scenes can take place inside the vehicle as its own location, with plenty of moving parts, and lots of items needing to be handled and interacted with.

![image](./images/unnamed_1189.png)

Oftentimes props can be very detailed and need lots of guides and instructions on how they work, along with versions made for close-ups and for far shots so that detailed versions can be reserved for up-close/insert shots.

![image](./images/unnamed_169.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_526.png)

Notice how a red line is commonly used to indicate to the color stylist that those lines should be self-colored or for that linework is meant to be removed once the shapes are painted:

![image](./images/unnamed_1027.jpg)

In a typical 2D animated series, there's frequently more props to be designed than they are characters. Sometimes props and character designs cross paths, like when a character removes an article of clothing from their body, then it becomes this independent item that comes off the character and is now technically a 'prop', since it's now an item another character could grab and pick up and interact with, and maybe dropped on the ground, then becoming part of the scenery.

![image](./images/unnamed_1284.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1556.png)

Sometimes, as part of the character design, the model sheets need to have props included, like a samurai warrior with their katana, or a wizard that's always holding their magic staff, a character always wearing their backpack, or a butcher always carrying a cleaver with them. Usually it's items that are inherently linked to the character at all times, making it part of their character design by default. These are accessories that the character always has with them, therefore become a part of that character's design.

Prop Design sheets for your portfolio can be displayed in several different ways, you can show 'progression' of your art by showing items in their exploration sketches, then rough stages, then clean and color stages, or you can compile them all together according to certain themes:

![image](./images/unnamed_864.png)

In the animation industry, prop model sheets display the item in different versions and various views or angles, and have similar templates to character sheets as well:

![image](./images/unnamed_489.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_148.jpg)

It's very common to have a character in the prop sheets as well, to show the size comparison for scale reference.

When it comes to prop design, an element of selective exaggeration and caricaturing is often implemented as well, just like you would for any character stylization/simplification - it all depends on the needs and the **look** of the production. Often the environments, props, and vehicle designs must be shaped and constructed in very particular ways to make them appear like they belong and match the world they're in, alongside the characters they'll be used with. They can evoke lots of life and personality in their appearance, but they are usually built to be **appealing** and **functional**. As an example, let's look at one particular aspect of prop designs; focusing specifically in the area of vehicles in the "choro-Q" style:

![image](./images/unnamed_1326.jpg)

> _"When designing vehicles for an animated production, it's always good to clearly display the characters' faces. Many shows have the characters with larger proportioned heads, so the windshields should be adjusted accordingly. Toriyama knew this, and a lot of his manga work featured appropriately-designed vehicles, but cartooned in a style that works well for showcasing the characters. This chibi-style of vehicles became a Japanese toy fad in the early 80s named choro-Q, and they were known in North America as penny racers." -Murray Bain, Art Director_

Keep in mind that the props your characters handle and the vehicles they operate are essentially acting as supporting characters. They need to be practical for the needs of the production and what is happening in the story. How the characters USE the props must be kept in mind when constructing their shapes, forms and proportions.

Vehicle concept designs from ParaNorman were well caricatured and still made functional to accommodate the characters that would be using them:

Just like for breaking down and making studies of a character's design, the same can be made for props to learn their structure and how they are built:

For whatever props you may be designing, experimenting how to exaggerate and simplify is part of the design exploration process, as with everything else, **research** is crucial. For example, drawing vehicles can be one of the most challenging aspects of prop design. Just like for character design, vehicle designs need to be researched and collected for you to be inspired from.

All these vehicles are just one of many facets of prop designs where you can vary proportions to give them personality.

Caricaturing architecture in a similar way is very common too:

![image](./images/unnamed_1316.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_964.jpg)

Shape Language plays a major part in the design process for props & backgrounds, and an exploration phase when creating the concept art is important as well.

Props and certain aspects of background design need several views and angles (for locations that will be seen very often):

**Style guides** can be made for prop design packs as well, these cross-over into background designs of course, as seen here for the Big Hero 6 series:

Notice how interior design and furniture as well as exterior architecture and be "caricatured" to give buildings a sense of personality and distinctiveness as well:

![image](./images/unnamed_730.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_980.jpg)

All animated productions have rules and guidelines like this, sometimes they are outlined in large volume and detail, many times they are barely documented officially at all, for reasons like lack of time to do so, and usually these style guides and directives are not solidified until late into the production.

The spectrum of Realism vs Caricature is present in all aspects of design stylization, including Backgrounds and FX designs as well. Some productions can barely have any FX design in them due to the nature of the stories, they don't require too many animated elements like, water, smoke, fumes, fire, splashes, ripples, sparks, electricity, and explosions. Other shows can have massive amounts needing to be made, depending on what the style and genre the story and world are set in. Sometimes the FX animators create their own FX designs based upon the storyboards and established art direction, other times dedicate 2D FX animators become designers to create key poses and colors to make sure the FX animations will stay on-style and consistent in its design and appearance. FX design are often overlooked and usually grouped into the Prop Design category of the design process.

![image](./images/unnamed_1097.jpg)

> 👉 [Rise of the TMNT movie: concept art and design sheets][vnirNyrpkc]

Sometimes FX designs cross-over into character model sheets, these could be special poses or custom design sheets to show how the FX are functioning with the characters:

Character![image](./images/unnamed_1021.png)

Character designers are essentially creating props all the time, the
clothes their characters wear, the glasses on their face, the hats on
their heads, as soon as they come off the character's body technically
becomes a prop.

### Walkthrough the Process

#### Pre-Boards and Post Boards

While character design happens continually through the production of each episode of an animated series, there are usually two primary stages:

Designs done BEFORE the storyboard artists start [boarding][qqwEexznKL], in order to give the storyboard artists the reference they need to draw the characters in their shots...

And designs done AFTER the storyboard is complete, wherein the designers base their designs on the storyboard artists' drawings.

The completed pack of design assets is something always in progress, from first reading and analyzing the script, through the storyboards stage and their revisions, then during character builds, and then even last minute additions and changes during layout & scene prep stages (just before animators start to animate the characters in their shots), and sometimes after animation has started. The odd thing here and there will need a quick design, since often some changes occur throughout each stage, and also, items get missed all the time and need to get caught and designed.

![image](./images/unnamed_1501.png)

Sometimes there's a strict and detailed breakdown made of the script, where most assets for characters, props and backgrounds are designed before storyboards begin, this way the storyboard artist has all the reference they need to plan out all their shots and sequences. Other shows have a very small, loose, rough preliminary design pack made, with barely any reference for the storyboard artist to use, giving the storyboard artist more creative liberties to create the concept of these designs, for you to use later to make the official design sheets out of. In this method the storyboard artist is encouraged to create, invent, expand upon the location designs, to make-up any secondary and incidental characters,whatever costume changes required, and create props/FX as needed, whether they were mentioned in the script or not.

This leaves a long list of items for the character designer to tackle, beyond all the assets mentioned in the initial script, but then they have the storyboards as a rough reference to start from, to eventually complete the list of design assets.

![image](./images/unnamed_788.png)

Incidental characters, designed using the storyboard as reference, is a very common part of the job.

No two productions are alike and the role and scope of a character designer's job can change significantly depending on the production, the pipeline, the supervisors/directors in charge and the style of the show

#### Design Handout

At the beginning of each episode, the character designer is given the script to read in advance of their design handout.

The design handout is the meeting where character designers are assigned their specific characters that they will need to design in preparation for boards. Sometimes the designs made before boards are called the _Fun Pack_.

This initial meeting, often called a Design Brief (or Briefing) is basically where it is decided what character(s) will be assigned to which artist and for what purpose. If the designer works directly for a client, for example, this is the part of the process that includes their communication with the person (Producer / Art Director / Supervisor) regarding the character(s).

In this phase, the artist should know the core personality of said character: is it a human, an animal, a creature, or an object (sometimes combinations of a few of these). It's not always obvious from the script or story outline alone. This brief also includes a list of certain personality traits and common emotional core values. Establishing the overall mood and mentality this character will communicate to the viewer. This list can be made by the designer by jotting down notes they made while reading the script or during the meeting with the art director or showrunner.

![image](./images/unnamed_957.png)

For example, if the project is an educational presentation aimed at third graders, it will require a cute and cheerful character that will appeal to children. Often your client may not be too certain or rock-solid about the backstory or personality, so they offer suggestions of what visual style they are looking for. They can instruct that the overall mood must be very warm and welcoming, even silly and fun. They may point you in the direction of a series, film, or short that they want you to use as inspiration. This phase, depending on the role of the character, is when the artists (or the clients) decide what the characteristics are. Some of those fundamental questions could be:

- What is the character's age? Where is the character from?
- What do they look like? What are their likes and dislikes?
- What are the character's dominant traits and personality?

During this meeting the Showrunner and the Director of the episode will also tell the designer if there are any particular attributes, racial specificity or personal characteristics that they want the designer to incorporate while designing.

Examples:

- _This character has a kind of Ryan Gosling, comical-cool type vibe._
- _This character is half Korean/half Puerto Rican so try to be conscious of this while designing them._
- _This character is an old alien boss, think Mr. Burns; make him frail, no teeth, hunchback, skinny limbs, big big-eyes, potbelly with a large cape._

![image](./images/unnamed_1055.png)

The designers receive their character assignments based on several factors:

- **The specific designer's strengths and sensibilities**
  - For example a character designer who is better with fashion may get the majority of the costume designs. A character designer who specializes in drawing animals will be favored to design the cast of characters for a pride of lions.
- **The availability of the designer**
  - Because multiple episodes are in play at once, some designers may wind up with more on their plate than others.
- **The designer's speed**
  - If a design needs to be turned out fast, it will usually be handed to the speedier designer.

Once the character designer has their allotted characters, they head back to their Cintiq/Tablet and get cracking.

![image](./images/unnamed_348.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_397.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_685.png)

#### Rough Sketches

Using photo reference, online images, and any specifications from the Director/Showrunner as their guide, the designer will start sketching out their rough ideas for the character.

After doing any necessary research on the subject, the designer will also incorporate their own taste and interpretation to give their designs flair and use their own artistic vision to really push the design.

The designer will create 3-6 different variations of sketches for the character with different [body shapes][ziuUzoXykL], outfits, hair styles, etc \-- this is the visual development/concept art stage. The goal is to create a nice variety of potential directions that still serve the story's designated characteristics. Make several iterations and go through your [checklist][rwLXtxQTYk].

Example:

- The script calls for a "_gym teacher_" character... Are they tall? Short? Lean? Buff? Super buff?
- The script calls for "_kids in the classroom_"... Are they 6, 8, 10 years old? Are they bored? Rowdy? Energetic?

The character designer explores all options.

![image](./images/unnamed_053.png)

#### Design Review

Once the designers have their rough sketches lined up, it's time for the review!

The Design Review is a meeting where the Art Director (main overseer of the overall look of the series) and the Showrunners look at the new designs and give their feedback and notes.

Usually the result of this initial design review will be a frankensteined new design, based on specific parts from the different sketches submitted.

The Showrunner might say: _"I like the head from #1, but the body from #3 and let's use the hair from #6"_.

Sometimes the Showrunner or Art Director will just like the one whole design with just some tweaks and adjustments needed \-- "_Let's go with #4, just shorten the hair, make the legs a bit longer_".

But the Frankenstein-ing approach is far more common.

![image](./images/unnamed_398.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_126.png)

#### Revisions and Revisions and Revisions

The process of _Design Review_ \>\> _Tweaks/Adjustments_ \>\> _Repeat_, can go on several more times until the Art Director and then the Showrunner is satisfied with the design.

It can take a while to get the exact look they are going for, to make certain it fits just right for the purposes of the show.

Usually if the small tweaks persist past a certain point, a Line Producer or Producer will step in and tell the design team and the Showrunner when time has run out, and to move on with the latest version, applying the final round of notes. Production Managers and Line Producers keep an eye on schedules and budgets, they let the creative process grow, flourish and expand as it's needed, but deadlines and deliverables can only be pushed so far, then they intervene to make sure the flow of production doesn't get bogged down for too long.

**Red-lining**, this the process an art director takes to draw-over your work with visual notes:![image](./images/unnamed_803.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_1119.png)

Variations in clothing and hair styles are the most common last-stage adjustments to make.

#### Rotations

Once a rough 3/4 front design of the character is somewhat settled and approved, it's time for the designer to turn the character!

TURN- AROUNDS are the process by which the character designer draws the design in different rotations: 3/4 Front, Front, Profile (Side), 3/4 Back, Back.

In TV animation, [turnarounds][GodgcXxUMt] are essential.

They are the guides that show the storyboard artists and more importantly, the animators, how the character looks from different angles and shows them how to keep the character on-model as they move them through different poses. On rigged character builds the builds artists use the designs to setup and assemble the character as a digital puppet for animators to move around and pose them in their scenes to prep them to be animated.

![image](./images/unnamed_628.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1041.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1010.jpg)

#### Does This Turn?

In order for the Builds team to construct and setup your characters into a proper and efficient rig (and for the animation to be fluid and believable), character designs NEED to be able to turn properly... and often times during this stage of rotating a character, designers will realize where certain features on the character do not turn well. Sometimes more flat and graphic designs are made out of many cheats where they are only meant to look good in a certain way at specific view.

Common things that can come up are:

- Body shapes or costuming that looks awkward from different angles
- Facial features that do not translate to certain angles well (ie: when the nose doesn't work in the front view)
- Clunky or angular parts of the design that are messy to turn

![image](./images/unnamed_074.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1165.jpg)

If a design doesn't turn well, chances are it won't animate well.

As a result of this, the designer often has to keep tweaking and changing the design to get it to rotate just right.

![image](./images/unnamed_065.gif)
![image](./images/unnamed_623.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1125.jpg)

By Parker Nielsen

Find the supervisor who will lead the **animation crew**, get advice from them and watch through the animatic/storyboards (if possible) to see if the character is meant to only be viewed in certain ways. This is because turning their head/body into these views might be quick-and-snappy in order to keep the stylistic qualities of the designs.

Communicating also with the department that will convert your designs into **builds** is important because oftentimes you can't be drawing attention to the fact that the character does not translate well in a three dimensional way. Some designs have lots of "cheats" to make them turn. The cheats make the design look good for each view, however it's made to look appealing with its graphic shapes, even though it may not be actually possible to three-dimensionally turn as a rotation, and that's fine for more stylized characters.

![image](./images/unnamed_1324.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_829.jpg)

#### Clean Lines

Once the character designer gets the design to rotate and has the roughs approved, they start cleaning up the line work... and once again more inconsistencies or odd things may arise in this stage, final detailing and fine-tuning in this stage of tying things down.

Designs are often tweaked again as they are cleaned up because the tighter line work makes design issues more obvious.

The entire character design process for the pre-board characters usually takes about 2 weeks from handout to clean-up.

Of course this can vary, depending on the production.

![image](./images/unnamed_909.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1348.png)

#### Is The Design Finished?

Designs may still be in flux right up until the episode actually goes out to go get animated.

The storyboards can also greatly affect the design.

For Example: The Director may request design changes based on new story changes or physical actions required of the characters made in the boards.

"I have a scene where Character X pulls up their hood to cover them from the rain, so let's be sure to give their jacket a hood"

![image](./images/unnamed_388.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_816.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_003.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_013.gif)
![image](./images/unnamed_050.gif)

DESIGN and BOARDS are very collaborative, almost in a hidden way, some shows independently operate in their own bubbles but rely on each other to use each other's work as reference, other times they're often informing each other both ways. The Director and Art Director usually work together to make sure their respective teams are alert to the shifts in design and story.

Another collaborative overlap are the riggers, who come in after the characters are completed in design and proceed to build and set up the designs for the animators to use. [Rigging][TjWaeocjUQ]
is a crucial process in animation that enables characters and objects to move fluidly.

Rigging in 2D animation is the process of creating a digital skeleton for characters or objects. This skeleton allows animators to control and manipulate movements with precision.

Effective rigging is essential for producing smooth, believable animations.

Key components of 2D rigging include:

- Joints and bones
- Control handles
- Deformation tools
- Hierarchy systems

By setting up these elements properly, they ensure that characters can be easily posed and animated. This saves time and enhances the overall quality of the animation.

As a rigger, they're primary responsibility is to build the underlying structure that brings characters to life. They work closely with animators and character designers to create rigs that are both functional and efficient.

Typical tasks include:

1. Analysing character designs
2. Placing joints strategically
3. Setting up control systems
4. Testing rig functionality

Riggers need a combination of technical skills and artistic understanding. They must anticipate how characters will move and ensure the rig supports these movements seamlessly.

![image](./images/unnamed_056.gif)
![image](./images/unnamed_072.gif)

#### Post Board Designs

Once the boards are done, the character designers may receive new designs in addition to whatever designs need to be tweaked based on boards.

To save designers time, during that initial **Handout**, Directors can call out which characters the board artists can board WITHOUT a pre-design...

But once the [storyboards][ZgCDKPbafN] are done, those boarded characters will still need to be designed properly.

![image](./images/unnamed_1163.png)

Screenshots of the boards are sent to the character designers who then create on-model character designs based on what the storyboard artists roughed in.

It is very common for storyboards to be completed with un-approved character designs in them, storyboards are rough, never 100% on-model or on-style, and the characters sketched in the boards are meant to be place-holders and used as reference for the process of creating the final designs. Then the rigs created from these designs will be the ones placed in & set up in each individual scene for the crew to animate with.

![image](./images/unnamed_675.png)

#### Alternates and Multiple Versions

These can be sometimes referred to as "ALTs" \-- these are designs required for hair and costume changes, but is also used for different states as well, like a charred or burned or wet versions of the character design.

![image](./images/unnamed_070.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_673.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1217.png)

#### Expressions, Mouth Charts & Special Poses

Another stage in the TV animation character design process is designing **expressions** and **mouth charts**. Once the boards are finished, the character designer will typically design mouth charts for the characters to be sent to the Builds team along with the turn-around which will have the characters get assembled and rigged into a build then sent to the animation team, along with the animatic (the storyboard assembled into a video with voices and sound effects to have the episode constructed into a blueprint showing all the camera moves, the length of each shot, and with the episode as a whole, at the proper length of time.

![image](./images/unnamed_868.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_881.jpg)

The mouth chart will guide the animators when they animate the characters speaking. They show what the character's mouth shapes are for the different syllables for all characters with speaking roles, this is for all the lip sync animation they'll have to do. This ensures that the character remains consistent as they speak their dialogue.

Expressions sheets are usually only made for primary characters, to show how to stay on-style as a spectrum of expressions are made as reference for animators to have so they can understand the characters better for their facial anatomy and range of emotions.

![image](./images/unnamed_706.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_673.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1433.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_686.png)

A **Special Pose** is a specific character design based on extreme or exaggerated or purposefully off-model drawings done by the board artist in the storyboard.

The character designer will tie down this extreme pose and make it more on-model, while keeping the same energy found in the board drawing.

This is to help the animation team know how to interpret and handle the very exaggerated or very specific pose in the board so it doesn't break style. These are usually drawn by the best artists on the crew and can be the most fun (and most difficult) to do.

Sample of Special Poses with storyboard comparisons:

![image](./images/unnamed_1087.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1335.png)

#### Do Character Designers Color Design?

Typically NO.

Most TV animation production pipelines have separate artists known as Color Stylists or Color Designers whose job is to color the characters and props.

TV animation character designers usually work predominantly in black and white.

Some character designers may use gray tones in their designs to help break up the linework, to make the designs clear for presentation purposes. Blocking out different shapes and subtly guiding the color stylist in the direction they were thinking.

Every show is it's own unique animal and there may very well be instances where you may be allowed (or asked) to color your characters designs. Especially on smaller productions where character designers are asked to complete many aspects of the design process.

![image](./images/unnamed_1052.png)

If you happen to have a knack for color, you may be asked to do color concepts in your rough drawings as well, at the very least, to get the process going.

![image](./images/unnamed_683.jpg)

#### Who Do I Work With? - Part one

Primarily, character designers work closest with the Art Director.

The art director (or design supervisor) is the foremost person in charge of the overall look of the series and tracking all assets. They guide and support the designers to make sure all the character designs stay ON-STYLE with the look of the show.

Character Designers will also receive notes from Directors and Showrunners. They may communicate with COlor Stylists to discuss their ideas for the color treatment on certain things. For example: "_I thought maybe this character's hair could be two-toned_".

![image](./images/unnamed_477.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_802.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1648.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1500.png)

#### Who Do I Affect? - Part one

Character designers affect the [storyboard artists][zhPXNnwqbz] but they are also heavily affected by them, along with directors as well. The way designers are used for the story can greatly dictate what the design needs. Designs and Boards are two very interdependent departments, and are often very symbiotic.

![image](./images/unnamed_1559.png)

Another department they communicate with are the artists that take the designs and create rigs out of your designs. The Builds team take the turnarounds and assemble it all into a model that the animators can use and manipulate in their scenes.

### Tools of the Trade

For the most part, character designers in TV animation are working with Adobe Photoshop, or similar programs like Procreate. Photoshop provides a tidy UI to both sketch and polish designs and is a software any aspiring designer needs to be fluent in.

There are many other illustration software like Gimp, Affinity, Clip Studio Paint, Krita, Paint Tool SAI, and Procreate. In reality, they can ALL do the job very well. Anything that allows you to export layers as bitmap (PNG alpha) images for the next artist to grab and use to build the character as a 2D rig is all you need. Your employer or supervisor may have specific requirements to use certain software, templates and resolution settings, these are all easy to ascertain and adapt to. Ask your client/director so that you can get familiar with the tools and templates ahead of time.

### Terminology

- **Intellectual Property:** Pertaining to creations of any artistic works, usually referred to as "IP". It can include designs, symbols, logos, names, and images used in all film, television or video games. It can be for individual characters, the series or film title, and even the concept of the world and story they reside in. A 'property' is always referring to the concept or show itself. See more general info on the term [here][nheUCtbrXL].
- **POC:** Proof of Concept is material (artwork or writings) typically derived from a pitch or pilot project, which demonstrates that a design concept or story proposal is feasible, and shows what the idea actually is. In animation it comes from pitching and attempting to sell a new intellectual property as an idea for a potential series or film and it applies for series, shorts and videogames. Creating a proof of concept for a new animated film or series could involve creating a pitch deck, which is a document or package of writings and artwork aimed at outlining what the concept is about and how it looks, usually containing character designs, background designs, character descriptions and the story premise. Sometimes an animated teaser or sizzle reel is made to show off the look and feel of what the animated property would be and these are also called a Proof of Concept.
- **Public Domain:** This refers to creative materials that are not protected by intellectual property laws such as copyright, trademark, or patent laws. The public owns these works, not an individual author or artist. Anyone can use a public domain work without obtaining permission, but no one can ever own it. Researching which characters are in public domain can help insure that and resemblances you do create for your own characters will or will not be in danger of any copyright infringements.
- **NDA:** A Non Disclosure Agreement is one of the first forms a producer will have you sign for them, even before a work contract. This is because an NDA is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship between you and your employer (producer/studio/client). The individual or parties signing the agreement all agree that the sensitive information they may obtain will not be made available to others. An NDA may also be referred to as a confidentiality agreement. If you are employed by a studio, oftentimes you need to sign one just to receive the visuals or written info about the characters/productions before your studio bids on the production or negotiates for the contract and budget, long before the work begins.
  - Non-disclosure agreements are also common for studios entering into negotiations with other studios, or a producer wanting to share information (scripts, designs, discussions about the production) with you, or the studio you're with. They allow the parties to share sensitive information without fear that it will end up in the hands of competitors. In this case, it may be called a mutual non-disclosure agreement. They are all the same in their intentions and purpose. In the video game industry there are very strict processes for security and not allowing any information about their projects to leak out to the public. They are very common and nothing to be afraid of, it means that you agree to not talk about the property with anyone else outside the production and your bosses. This includes anything online; emails, texts, conversations, and social media.
- **Onboarding:** A human resources term referring to the process of introducing a newly hired employee into an organization. For a new designer in an animation or gaming studio, it's an important part of helping employees understand their new position and job requirements. This usually consists of tours and handing the new employee some documents showing contact info of your leads/supervisors, descriptions of the production you are working on, getting familiar with the file server, workflow guides, schedules and lists of deadlines, info as to how to submit your work, and receiving any references for the tasks that are required of you.
- **Pipeline:** A term that refers to the [workflow][vQyatgQSRl] for the entire production. The bigger the production, the bigger the crew, the bigger and longer the pipeline. Design departments sit near the beginning of the production pipeline, but various forms of design tasks continue throughout the entire production, especially on an episodic-based series, and even in feature films where designs are needed even in final visual effects stages. See [this][cXPZJvwWgT] for where and how designs fit into the pipeline of a typical 2D animated series, and see [this][TAnFifXGAj] for how the production portion of the pipeline works in a 3D animated feature film.
- **Demographic:** This term is used to describe who the designs (and the production) are aimed for. In most cases there's an age range (or a target audience) for the animated characters being created along with the stories & world they're a part of. While designing the character you should keep in mind the nature of the audience viewing these characters. For example, if you are designing the characters for children it should be designed with basic shapes and colors. The genre and rating on the game or the genre and rating of the film you are designing for is usually your main indicator of what age group this production will be targeted for. Designs for a horror game will have a very different art direction than what you will find in a kids' game like Minecraft, Lego, or Little Big Planet. A game or an animated series for mature audiences will have characters looking differently compared to characters found in a game or series made for kids under 12 year-olds, and even more different for preschoolers.
- **S&P:** Standards and Practices, the term used by broadcasters and networks as a set of corporate rules to follow to self-regulate the content on the animated series, strongly depending on the demographic, the younger the intended audience the longer the list for S&P for everyone to follow. For example, there are long lists of S&P for children's or pre-school series, since it's intended for young audiences, for adult animated content, the S&P regulations are far less. For PG or Teen related demographics, the level of violence depicted on screen must be limited. S&P passes are made during script writing, designs, storyboarding, and final animation stages. Revision notes may come in on character designs in order to remove or change aspects of the design they may deem as inappropriate or not on-brand.
- **EP:** Executive Producers consult on the production and provide specialist expertise. They may also help other [producers][ilWSObzdKo] on the business side of things by facilitating the finances and contracts between broadcaster, distributor and the service studio providing the design and animation work. Some producers are in charge of fundraising and marketing for the production. The title of executive producer may also be credited to the original creator of the source material that is being adapted, and as a result, may also serve as head writer and showrunner for the series. They are often the ones seeking out and hiring the writers, directors and other key personnel to get the production started once it is greenlit and set to go.
- **PM:** Production Manager, the person to go to for contracts, schedules, and payment questions and concerns. They manage all the stages of the production's deadlines and track each artist's daily and weekly progress. They can often act as the human resources person as well, but usually are the ones most in communications with the client/executive producer.
- **Showrunner:** The series showrunner is the person with the overall vision for the production. Writing, producing, and creative leadership is their main focus. They work closely with voice casting, voice recording, scriptwriting, character development, and guiding the heads of departments like episodic directors, art directors, animation supervisors, storyboard supervisors, and post production supervisors. This is to ensure that all aspects of the production in each stage on the creative level, are on-style and up to the appropriate levels of quality.
  - Oftentimes the showrunner is the creator of the series concept, and sometimes this role is in two people's hands, where they split the responsibilities - usually one showrunner focuses on scripts, voices, storyboards, sound designs & music, and the other showrunner overlooks designs, animation, backgrounds, colors, compositing/FX and quality assurance. Sometimes they act as the head writer, supervising director, or creative director for the series. Other times they will communicate all their thoughts about character design to the art director so that the info can be transferred to the designers. Other times the design style comes from their personal style directly, so a designer would work closely with showrunners at the beginning, to achieve the look they're going for.
- **Design Coordinator:** This can have many other names, such as, Assets Manager, Design Supervisor, Artistic Coordinator, but their role is to assist the Art Director in managing the deliveries, approvals, versions, and scheduling of the design process. When there's dozens of episodes overlapping, the number of characters, props, and key locations that accumulate on the production can go into the hundreds, and when the Art Director is focusing purely on the creative & artistic side of things while conducting quality control amongst their designers, sometimes a design coordinator is needed to manage all the many lists of assets and design elements on the show.
- **Pilot:** The first episode of a series, created to test the concept, characters, and overall potential of the show before committing to a full season. It serves as a proof of concept and a pitch to networks and streamers, showcasing the show\'s premise and style. If the pilot is successful, the show is \"picked up\" and a full season is produced, with the pilot often becoming the premiere episode.
- **Visual Development:** The building blocks for any type of visual art, from concept art to graphic design, illustration, animation, and gaming. The scope of a visual development artist's work gives them a level of professional creative control that is vital to the entire process. This comes from the versatility of their work being applicable to a wide variety of media formats. They're responsible for creating the mood, tone, and color palette of these worlds created from the writers, and creators of the property. No task or element is too large or small; as a visual development artist, you can design sets, environments, characters, clothing, vehicles, props, furniture, lighting, visual effects, and just about everything else that appears in all aspects of a visual work. More info [here][ObagHnrbyM] on the skill sets required in being part of a Vis Dev team. More info [here][kCIVoFscwL] on the work that is made to develop the Art Direction for a film or series.
- **Shape Language:** A concept used in design and animation to communicate a mood, story, or history behind the design. Giving familiar meanings to the shapes the characters are made with. When used in character, prop, and background design, shapes can tell a story, show personality, and elicit an emotional response in the viewer without using any words or movements. Depending on the character's overall shape or combination of shapes that make up their physicality, it can give visual hints as to the character's nature and core identity. Design Language and Shape Design are alternate terms used for the same theory.
- **Thumbnails:** Small rough sketches, drawn fast to create lots of ideas for designs or poses, and used to explore various concepts, creating a way to visually rehearse what works and what doesn't.
- **Reference:** Materials, assets, and images provided to (or researched by) the artist to have as a strict or casual guide to follow. These can be used for [inspiration][FCELcyDien] to the art direction of the property being designed.
- **Turnaround:** The rotation of the character displaying multiple views/sides to be used as reference for the building and animating of the character, see [this guide][bNFRFvisSv] on the process.
- **Construction:** Refers to when you're breaking down your character into their basic shapes and forms to reveal the inner structure. Construction lines are usually the geometry, cross-hairs, and guidelines that are drawn through the character's features to show the three-dimensional aspects of their body parts.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_564.png)
- **Anthropomorphic:** Human-like physical attributes in a non-human character, usually referring to an animal character that acts human, as seen in many animated properties and storybooks. Not just biped animals but 4-legged animals standing up-right. These are [animals][tupFqwORoK] depicted as walking, talking, dressing, and behaving like people. Even animated smoke that takes the form of a person can be described as anthropomorphic.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_276.png)
- **Asset:** A general term for all aspects of designs and rigs, including all states and versions of characters, props, FX, and backgrounds. Even though they go through their various stages of rough, color, builds, etc., they all need to be tracked for the progress of each design element, and these are all referred to as 'Assets'. On big productions there can be Assets Managers and Design Coordinators in charge of tracking all assets, which is usually referring to all the individual visual elements seen on-screen. Designated asset names and numbers are determined after the script is complete and then again after storyboards are complete.
- **Lead Sheet:** A spreadsheet outlining all design elements found in the production. In an animated series all characters, props, FX, and environments/locations are listed and cataloged for which shots they all appear in for each episode. At first these are broken down from a script as a preliminary design pass, then after storyboards are complete, any additional designs created are extracted from the animatic to then be added to the library of design assets to be officially made. As the production moves forward and more episodes are completed and locked at script and storyboard stages, the more lead sheets are made and updated. These breakdowns are sometimes called a Route Sheet, Assets List, Design List or Log List. A script 'breakdown' is the process of extracting all the information from the story to produce lists of all design assets like this, the process is done again after a storyboard/animatic is finalized to list all the on-screen design elements that were added by the story artists.
- **Design Brief:** A meeting to discuss the design tasks, happening just before the first pass of the design process. On a feature film this can happen for each new sequence that goes into production, on a series it happens before each episode enters production, usually every week or two. It's accompanied with a document created by the showrunner, creative director, art director, or episodic director to give to the design crew as a guide for each episode's breakdown, for any new design elements that need to be created. It's a process usually reserved for 2D or 3D animated shows where each script is analyzed and visual reference is compiled for specific direction on how to produce the new key backgrounds and characters found in the story.
  - Also known as a **Design Kickoff** or **Design Launch**. These meetings with the designers have the art director or series director talk about the specifics of the design tasks that are next to be started in the production. These are discussions on the direction and approach for new characters or character re-dresses.Briefings can look like excerpts from the script pages with images in the margins (on the side of the text); Showing reference images like sketches, photos, and thumbnails for the artist to follow as visual guides. Other briefings can look like a simple document or design kit with reference images and descriptions, provided by the director.
- **Design Kit:** Usually something handed out during a Design Brief, these are also known as a Ref Sheet, Guide Sheet or Reference Pack. It's a document containing various visual references or guidelines for particular designs that can be used by the designers as a target to have in mind while they work. A Design Kit or Design Handout can even be a "how-to guide" with files and imagery showing how to create certain artistic aspects of the design style, it can have tutorials on how to achieve a certain look or effect. These sometimes include focused step-by-step processes and technical information as well. These kits can be handed out during or just after the design launch and are made for designers to have them to better know what the intended look and style of specific design tasks they are assigned, usually made after the storyboards are done.
- **Show Bible:** Can be referred to as a Design Bible when specifically made for Art Direction. Show Bibles contain all the general information needed for the design team to use as reference for the overall style of the series for both characters and backgrounds. It can also have guidelines for how to handle and produce other aspects of the production as well, like the writing style (for the scriptwriters), the shooting style (for the storyboard artists), and the sound design style (for the musical score and sound effects artists).
- **Deliverables:** A list of what stages will need to be delivered for your work. Sometimes there's specific deadline dates to follow, other times it's more of a general weekly arrangement of deliverables to submit for review for each character and for each stage of the design process. The actual design package put together that is needed to go out every week for a client or showrunner to review can also be referred to as 'deliverables'.
- **Redress:** A character that's already been designed and finished, but is now partially re-designed to create new and different versions. Usually alternate varieties like hair style and costume changes. Examples can be stuff like adding a backpack, having wet hair, added gloves, torn clothes, different boots, burned/charred clothes, damaged armor, muddy clothes, or a new hat/hooded jacket pulled over the head.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_551.png)
- **ALT:** Alternate or Alterative, usually referring to an alternative to a design. When presenting ALTs, you usually show different versions as options to use, sometimes minor design or color variations.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1306.jpg)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_674.jpg)
- **Off-Model:** A term used to point out how a design or the drawing/posing of a character is off-style or inaccurate to how they should look. When some feedback is given on some designs, character layouts, or animation poses the notes can refer to them as being "off-model". They need to be revised and redrawn to be "on-model" by using the reference shown in the provided revision notes, style guides and model sheets. Sometimes moments are drawn to purposefully look off-model to capture the intent of the scene for the more extreme nature of the expression/pose at the time, [Ren & Stimpy][bclbwYQovE] famously did this constantly. Other times the designs go off-model but for the purpose of creating or copying another art direction style entirely, therefore creating new models to be used for just a scene or specific to that sequence or episode, as often seen in [Teen Titans Go!][PnmemvCDsg]
- **3pt, 4pt, 5pt:** Abbreviations for how many views to illustrate when creating the rotations for the characters, for example - 3 point turnarounds are usually Front, 3/4 Front, 3/4 Back views - 5 point turnarounds are usually Front, 3/4 Front, Side, 3/4 Back, Back views. This can range between 2pt and 16pt.
- **Lineup:** When one view of multiple characters is placed on one sheet to see them all at once for [size comparison](#size-comparison-charts) purposes. It's important to show the scale of all your characters relative to each other.
- **Fun Pack:** The pre-board design bundle, all the design sheets for the primary characters and locations, sometimes as rough designs, to be used as reference for the storyboard artists. This is usually the bare minimum design sheets a board artist needs to know what the cast and settings depicted in the script look like. Final model sheets then builds happen during and after the storyboard process.
- **MDP:** Main Design Pack, the completed sets of all the main characters and background designs, to have as reference for all departments.
- **Style Guide:** This expands upon the Pitch Deck/Show Bible, having elements of the model pack but refers to all character and prop/location design references for the film or series, and expands upon it. With a focus on guides for how to create the backgrounds and characters in its particular style. It covers many aspects of the production's art direction; as shown [here][EnOdWUETgf] and [here][vixrTCJgQb]. They can be small or large and elaborate documents that outline DOs & DONTs for the animation teams and background painters, or specific "how-to-draw" playbooks for the design crew.
  - These are sometimes also called Pasteup Sheets and [Breakdown][CARdkahxoa] Sheets. Style guides can also be made for [background layout][QSAgTeMHEm] designs and [storyboarding][gYHYJYgkff]; and for painting and color guides as shown [here][nyKMoDmAve]. Style guides are a great way to bring together a group of people to create one cohesive style for the design and layout/animation teams. [Style guides](#style-guides) can even be created before the concept goes into production, and later the MDP becomes included in the style guide.
  - Thinking about what your style guide would look like is a great place to start when developing your show or film concept as a pitch idea, you begin by laying down all the visual rules and standards. These can also be called a Design Bible, usually seen in animated series, and one can be made for each department: Script Bible, Storyboard Bible, Animation Bible, each one made specific for the team of people working in those stages of production.
- **Workbook:** Usually used in 2D animated feature film productions, it is an expanded upon style guide/lookbook & background design guide. It is made during the character design / production design phase and it keeps growing in size and scope while overlapping storyboards and layout stages. It's a collection of artwork and guidelines for design, color, lighting, staging and layouts, and handed out to all artists to use as reference.
- **Readable:** A term used to identify how much a design or pose can be "read". Meaning the more readable a design is, the more clear and recognizable it will be. A design that doesn\'t read refers to a character visual that is difficult to understand or identify at a glance, often due to confusing silhouettes, overly complex details, or a lack of distinct features that make it hard to discern their personality or role in a story.
- **Plusing:** A broad term you get from notes made by a director or producer, generally meaning to plus the design further, adding more quality and refinement to a certain area or to the overall artwork.
- **Naming Convention:** A system established on how to label and name the designs relative to how the digital files are named. There's a million different ways of doing so, and most of the time your supervisor/director on the production will establish a template for you to follow.
  - Char_Julian_CLR_TRN_V05
  - Char_Maximus_CLN_TRN_V04
  - Char_RoyBatty_RGH_TRN_V03
  - Here's a common template to use for the asset naming method. This one shows the first part identifying the asset as a character, the second part is the name of the character, then the status being concept art or rough or clean line art or color, then the state that it is a turnaround, and then the version number. You can have acronyms of the series name and the season and episode numbers and short forms for Rough (RGH) Clean-up (CLN) and Color (CLR) and many others that a supervisor or director usually determines.
  - You can also have the series abbreviated name and season+episode number as shown here...
  - JT_S01E10_Cha_MrEagle_CON_TRN_V02
- **Color Roughs:** Thumbnails or rough sketches made with paints rather than line work.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1425.png)
- **Draw-Overs:** When a supervisor or director sketches over a pose or design to visually show what adjustments need to be made for the design revisions. These are also called redlines or red-lining.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_045.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_208.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_208.png)
- **Clean-up:** The finished line art, the process of [tracing-over][nJokjiFBPG] rough designs to produce the [final lines][JdtPktvCSa] on the characters. Various styles and [weights][OvBuRpDCnZ] to the lines can be used. Depending on the art direction, sometimes a much thicker outline is required (like Dexter's Laboratory and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy), or very thin linework (like Family Guy and Bob's Burgers), or wobbly/boiling linework (like Ed, Edd & Eddy), or thick-to-thin tapered lines (like Sam & Max, The Hollowand Primal), or a messy dry brush style (like Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends and Jacob Two-Two), or a loose/sketchy line style (like Tante Hilda), or a graphite pencil-textured line art style (like Penn Zero and Green Eggs & Ham), or a nearly lineless style (like Samurai Jack). Search up all of these, have fun collecting design styles!
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1725.png)
- **Line Weight:** The thickness of your lines. Sometimes referred to as Line Gauge.
- **Line Value:** The color and lightness/darkness of your lines.
- **Self-traced:** Also known as self-colored or self-inked, referring to the colored line art in your design. The line work is sometimes just a lighter or darker version of the base fill color found around the line, instead of the typical black lines on a character design.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1433.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_369.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_214.png)
  - Example; Spongebob's colored outlines are just a darker tone from his base skin color. See how Daffy's arms and facial features have outline colors turning white when crossing over the body or line work needing to be visible for expressions - this way they don't get lost as the dark-on-dark color overlaps. [FX designs][QowYnHYJfl] like water, fire, and smoke are often made of colored outlines, or no lines at all.
  - Self-traced lines can be used to make the lines visible when they would normally disappear or blend in too much, or can simply be painted lines, anything other than the default black tone, to make the linework stand out more clearly. Another example is when you need to isolate the edges of where the shadows are on your black-and-white character designs.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1523.png)
- **Draw-Throughs:** When you need to show what is underneath a design element or body part, usually hair, capes, cloaks or even an arm that is overlapping the torso.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1151.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_461.png)
- **Economy of Line:** The concept of the line economy is a familiar one to anyone who has studied ﬁgure drawing or has done classical animation. Basically, it means that we should strive to draw efﬁciently by using fewer lines to say what we need to say, rather than a lot of unnecessary lines that lack a sense of intent. In character design this translates to visually depicting everything you need without unnecessary details, capturing the shapes, forms and personalities with as few lines as possible. This is associated with the term 'line mileage' which means the amount of lines drawn in a design, illustration, or any hand-drawn animation scene. The more line mileage a design has, the longer it takes to re-draw that design over and over again.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1509.png)
- **Cel Shading:** A technique used in illustrations and animation to give 3D objects and characters a more 2D/cartoon-like appearance. The term \"cel\" refers to celluloid, the clear plastic sheets that were once used in traditional animation to create [hand-drawn][zJeXHZqhZy] animations. Most commonly seen in [anime][pFHhwjVvJr], where the shadows are hard-edged as opposed to a soft-edge. There's a similar look with [toon-shading][WPfOgNVBrs]; a rendering technique designed to make 3D computer graphics appear to be flat by replacing smoothly mixed in gradient shaders from the shadows, highlights and tones to appear as blocks of color and hard-edged shapes, along with the outer edges and inner details having an illustrative line added to it, to mimic [flat cartoon][kFVFcUJxGl]/[comic book][cveLFbbbsV] style artwork.

  - ![image](./images/unnamed_628.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1651.png)
- **Rim Light/Rim Shadow:** Tone shading indicating a light source on a character, they can also have a hard edge or soft edge.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1599.png)
- **DX or Alpha:** The level of transparency on a color or tone, usually for a shadow overlay, or the amount of opacity on a certain character element, often seen for eyeglasses.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_935.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1367.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1475.png)
- **Back Lit:** Also known as BCKLIT, simply an old school term that means having a glow effect on a certain element or the entire character. Could be a glowing gem on your character's chest, a glowing light from the helmet on their head, or glowing eyes.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1120.png)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_349.png)
- **Breaking the Model:** Also known as 'break the design' - simply the process done before cleaning up the character into vector art, by separating all the elements of your character. Which means drawing all the pieces in full that are hidden by other overlapping body parts. This is to set it up for the [rigging process][oebyXvlcTO] by layering all the elements separately, filling in any gaps. This can be done by a clean-up artist or character setup artist or builds artist.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1053.png)
- **Builds and Rigs:** When character designs are broken up, converted and assembled into fully [setup rigs][daJaIxKtFW] with all their colored assets included. Mouth packs for lip sync, body/head rotations & tilts for various views of the subject, and blink comps for the eyes are just some of the many components created in the [rigging][JnXJtXkGoj] stage of production. These [rigs][OZMbDhbDWA], once completed, get handed over to scene setup and then for animators to use in their shots. Often referred to as Builds or Models in 3D/CG animated productions. Also referred to as Puppets or Rigs for Stop-motion productions where the 2D designs are translated into handmade sculpts and fabricated into 3D-printed body parts to be assembled with armatures for them to be posed, animated, and filmed.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_069.gif)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_062.gif)
- **Stock:** Referring to Stock Art or Stock Animation. It's when there\'s a pre-made set of designs, animated movements/cycles or body parts that animators use to recycle and implement into their scenes. Stock Hands could be a library of hand poses that animators extract from a build to use in their scene. Stock Walk Cycle would be an animated walk that was created for animators to grab and insert into their scenes to save them the trouble of re-doing one from scratch. Actions and poses like Jumps, Turns, Blinks, Runs, Expressions and Mouth Shapes (mouth charts for lip sync) can all be considered Stock Art to be saved, archived, and re-used by the builds & animation crew when needed.
- **Character Layout:** On a 3D/CG production this is the process of setting up the initial [staging of a scene][MkONnVhzeX], including camera angles, character positions, and key movements to match and improve upon the storyboard's composition and shot framing. This sets up the scene to be prepped for the animators to start on their shots. On a hand-drawn/2D animated production this is a rough posing pass made after storyboards are completed on a traditionally-animated series or film. This is where you draw out the extremes and the main tent poles of the character staging to plot out the acting and action along with the camera angle & framing. Special Poses and Character Layout work can be a great start on your road to becoming a character designer, as work like this shows your ability to draw consistently and on-model, while displaying artistic skill, speed, and diversity in your draftsmanship.

  - ![image](./images/unnamed_759.jpg)
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1242.jpg)
- **Special Poses:** When a designer draws certain moments from the storyboard that need more attention to make sure they're clear for the animator. Similar to character layouts, where the artist essentially does a re-draw of the storyboard pose to be more on-style and more specific, this can include forced perspective, difficult angles, or a very extreme/exaggerated or particular pose of the character as well. A director or supervisor chooses which drawings get to be made into special poses. These are moments that are either pivotal to the episode or gags that need to make a super clear translation from the storyboard to the final animation. Sometimes these special poses are meant to purposefully be off-model to exaggerate the acting in the scene.

### Summary

- **Designing a New Character**

  - Step 1: Research and discovery
  - Step 2: Hone in on your character\'s traits
  - Step 3: Do lots of sketching
  - Step 4: Finalize your character design drawing (begin with a front view or 3/4 view)
  - Step 5: Create the full rotation for the turn-around views
  - Step 6: Develop some rough poses and expressions
  - Step 7: Get feedback

- **Strategies on your Approach**

  - Personality!
  - Visual Interest!
  - Simplicity & Recognizability - Add details and complexity later, if needed
  - Avoid Clichés - Unless that's the intention
  - Know The Character's Story - Where does a character begin, where does it end, and what does it do in-between?
  - In the beginning, when you're only exploring concepts; draw more loose, rough, and fast - create lots of thumbnails!
  - Shape & Form - Consider how the character\'s shapes work in three dimensions and how they look from different angles, while you are searching for that character of yours, play around with hair/fur styles, various attitudes/postures and costumes/outfits \> Afterwards, think about detailing & surfacing - are textures, shading or shadows needed?
  - What is the character's linework? - Is it thick or thin, tapered or varied, bumpy or textured, colored lines or perhaps no lines at all!
  - Paint - Explore color options (if required), use color to differentiate personalities, highlight features and create contrast \> Color can also convey a character\'s mood, attitude, and role in the story!

- **Things To Keep in Mind**

  - [✓] Appeal/Believability: Balance originality and familiarity. Create visually appealing silhouettes. Consider how the character\'s design reflects their role and personality traits. For example, iconic characters like Homer Simpson, Mickey Mouse, and Mario have simple yet recognizable designs.
  - [✓] Use References Effectively: Research distinctive styles. Try out a range of possibilities, then repeat and experiment. Seek out and incorporate feedback from others you trust.
  - [✓] Uniqueness: Make your character visually distinct and easily recognizable by incorporating symbolic or iconic elements.
  - [✓] Audience: Consider what will make your character appealing and believable to your demographic.
  - [✓] Backstory: Give your character some history, personality, and motivations that help explain how they look; torn jeans, makeup, scars, braces, hunched back, messy hair, a cane, an eyepatch, an arm cast - things that could add story to their disposition and individuality.
    - Full breakdown [here][aHTcjszNVG] and [here][tPjKhLFdQl].

> Four factors to consider when designing your new characters from an established property:

1. Recognizability of the intended visual style
2. Shapes, features, and volumes are consistent throughout the rotation
3. Linework and details all follow a natural sense of logic and appeal
4. Overall anatomy, proportions, and costumes/surfaces are consistent to the established graphic style

☝️ This is also a general rubrics for each of the assignments outlined below.

![image](./images/unnamed_1490.png)

---

The assignments and theory covered below are more intended for 2D animated series/films, but the practice and approach for them can all be applicable to 3D/CGI/Stop-motion & Video Game development as well. The most important thing to remember is to have fun with them!

![image](./images/unnamed_377.png)

In terms of timespan; you can hit these 12 assignments full-time and expect to complete them all in roughly 30 to 60 hours total \-- Depending on research-time and personal speed, your results may vary. This was originally created as part of an animation program where students would spend 3-6 hours per week, executing each assignment as homework.

The hours increase as the requirements & parameters go up in the later assignments - in which case, picking away at these exercises and completing all assignments within 10 weeks at a very casual pace is often the preferred approach. But this could be all done within just a 1 to 3 weeks at a more steady and dedicated pace, this includes reading, watching, listening to all external links and supplementary materials. So don't be concerned about your output, go at your own speed, and produce the best work you can.

You may use the designs you create from these assignments for your portfolio, while citing credit to the original studio/artist \-\-- Example: ©Disney ©WB ©Matt Groening

The Assignments outlined below are to create a NEW character within a chosen established style from an existing series/film.

There are many more specific aspects of character design methods and theories to apply to your work within the rest of these chapters - you will see these with each Assignment, as they gradually cover more principles and techniques with tutorials and advice on various subjects.

You will notice a wide range of design aesthetics to learn from, and some visual guides showing you how to explore these design styles even further. So far, this document (and the many links provided) display a solid starting ground, which can help inform your decisions in the early stages of the development for your character design process. There's a few more technical things to be aware of, and you'll see them as you go through these series of practice exercises. There's lots more links and visual aids to be inspired from, time to place all this knowledge into practice, keep scrolling down to see.

> Support Material:

- [Using Photoshop to Draw Characters][TGEUrRIrbB]
- [Form & Structure in Design with Antonio Stappaerts][zIrDSgdPnn]
- [Character Design Fundamentals from Robert Cory][bHIUmiDvfI]

Begin with lots of rough sketches, study the references provided, and start to narrow down the sort of character you want to create.

Make some decisions as to which character you wish to refine and create a **front** or **3/4 front** view.

Once you've done one view, use it as a guide to match the proportions and positions of your body parts for other views so they'll line up properly for an accurate rotation:

Advice from Andy Ristain, lead designer on _Adventure Time_:

Developing an understanding of how to construct a successful character design, and bringing together the components required to execute it commercially, are hard-won skills. But with this expertise comes a wealth of opportunity for those with the passion, drive and imagination to pursue it.

The goal of a character designer is to make the main characters as appealing as possible in as simple a way as possible.

A cartoon about the last human boy, Finn, and a shape-changing dog named Jake, Adventure Time follows their journey in a post-apocalyptic world called Ooo. I think that challenge is what attracted me to character design.

The cast of characters from the Adventure Time series, featuring the main protagonists Finn and Jake, was originally created for a younger audience, but the series has grown and matured into a cultural phenomenon that appeals to adults and children alike. The show has continuity and the actions and decisions the characters make have lasting repercussions.

To become truly great at crafting characters, illustrators need to invest the time in developing their own visual language at the most basic level -- by drawing every day. Taking inspiration from nature and his surroundings, mastering character design is a process that can\'t be rushed.

If you\'re building a family of characters, it can help to create a set of rules that define their graphical elements, before then experimenting with size and proportion. And try to think in three dimensions, draw a character and consider how it would look from the side, back and front -- not just flat on the screen.

For budding character designers, I have three key tips:

- Experiment with shape and form
- Take the time to let your mind wonder
- Keep drawing

> "It takes time, practice, effort and a lot of exploration, but if you keep digging you\'ll eventually find a place that\'s totally your own."

Samples of this design style:

![image](./images/unnamed_1392.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1086.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_891.jpg)

Doing clean lines and colors are completely optional at this stage, later assignments explore color.

![image](./images/unnamed_978.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1227.png)

Clean- up and color pass is encouraged, but ALWAYS optional for these exercises. These are intended to be more black-and-white, line art only. Later on, color becomes compulsory for a select few exercises, for now tight roughs like these for a turnaround sheet is all you need.

![image](./images/unnamed_245.png)

Feel free to go the extra mile, to do clean-up and color if you want to.

### Approach for Designing Characters

The secret to being a versatile character designer is to absorb the knowledge from as many artists as possible and filter-in the aspects that speak true to you. Take your time, watch and listen to the video essays provided below here, and in all the chapters from all the following Assignments. Remember and apply the aspects that make most sense to you. But be open to everything, various styles and techniques are explored and displayed. These are just to get you in the proper mindset, they explore an assortment of different principles, methods, and theories:

- [Learn to Draw in Any Style with Joshua Adeoye][iqJGCTUbai]
- [Talking About Character Design with Daniel Arriaga][FdFBMLdTIp]
- [Wouter Tulp Design Tips 1][rCNplyYGRA]

- [Brookes Eggleston - How To Be A Character Designer][DlalGXFLCH]
- [Brookes Eggleston - The Process][AlcghHAshO]

Valerio Fabbretti was the art director for _The Fungies!_ animated series and Becky Dreisdadt who worked as the character supervisor for _Adventure Time: Distant Lands_, have gone over the process together involved in a typical cartoon character design and how to build a portfolio focused on this aspect, these are portions from a webinar they had hosted:

> CHARACTER DESIGN FOR AN ANIMATED SERIES

![image](./images/unnamed_479.jpg)

In terms of character design, Becky comments that it is important to know how to draw in a great variety of angles. Depending on the relevance of each character, it may even be necessary to include additional information and sketches. That's why it's better that you are deeply familiarized with each character, in case you ever need to bring up more details about them as needed.

![Cartoon Character Design](./images/unnamed_1366.jpg)

Either way, with every character that you work on you need to create a register on how the mouth moves when making sounds or speaking. This is of great help to the animators when they need to work on scenes where there are dialogues. Of equal importance is to draw the characters with different expressions on their faces, for example, when they are happy, sad, scared or angry.

![image](./images/unnamed_166.jpg)

And although it is something not done frequently, Becky admits that one of the most difficult tasks in character design is to draw scenes where there are crowds involved. You need to know not only which characters are going to be in the crowd, but also how many of them will be and how to draw them together but in a way that each one is easily distinguishable. Of course, you need to avoid making tangent lines. This can be difficult while working in a unique character design and even more so where there are multiple ones in a crowd. If this isn't hard enough, you also need to be able to draw the crowds as seen from different angles.

![image](./images/unnamed_552.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1311.png)

Sometimes you also need to modify a character design that's already established. This can be either because it needs a new costume, accessories or to show some battle damage in their attire. In this case, you need to follow the references provided by the artist that made the original design, but you are also free to take your own approach and give it some of your personal style. This way you can come up with new and exciting versions of a character design.

> THE PROCESS BEHIND CREATING A CHARACTER DESIGN

- The Art of Steven Universe [(1)][objlqvjvKT] [(2)][jyAnxtmBkn]

When a team of artists gets a new storyboard, Valerio explains that they first analyze it to find if there are any new characters or elements that need to be designed for the episode. After taking note of any new designs that need to be done, he assigns them to each artist taking in consideration their strengths and weaknesses, as well as what they tend to like drawing more.

![image](./images/unnamed_1176.png)

Being the art director, Valerio is responsible for making sure that each character design stays true to the show creator's vision. Not only does he supervise the design process for the characters, but also the way color is applied on them and finally, the way they are animated. After all, it's his job to make sure that there aren't any errors and that the final art is top notch.

![image](./images/unnamed_1233.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_384.png)

As for Becky, being a character supervisor, she is also deeply involved in this process. She is in charge of supervising her team of artists specializing in character design, as well as reporting back to the art director. One of her tasks is also making a guide of rules and important elements that every artist on her team must follow while creating a character design.

This can be like the way eyes should be drawn, the proportions that must be considered, general mistakes to avoid and so on. This in turn helps to decrease the times a design needs to be corrected, speeding up the process of working on each one of them. Also she is the one responsible for creating the designs for the major characters in each episode.

![image](./images/unnamed_537.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_194.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_206.jpg)

> THINGS YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO

![Cartoon Character Design](./images/unnamed_019.jpg)

Valerio says that one of the most important things is to know about anatomy. That's why he is so keen on observing if an artist is capable of drawing eyes, hands and feets. In his opinion, this is an indication that the artist knows about anatomic proportions, thereforth is easily able to adapt to different art styles while maintaining the correct proportions.

![image](./images/unnamed_712.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_914.png)

It's also vital to know about perspective, because as a character design artist, you need to be able to draw in a wide range of angles while giving a sense of depth in your work. Becky, on the other hand, says that it's fundamental to know about storytelling. That is why she prefers portfolios that show some experience or at least understanding in storyboards and comics. Of course, authenticity is greatly appreciated, so you need to include mostly designs for original characters that you created.

![image](./images/unnamed_942.png)

How about showing off that you are proficient in drawing multiple art styles? If you are really great at it, then go for it. But it's not necessary in Valerio's opinion. He says he prefers seeing an artist with a unique style in which he truly is good at. After all, if you are talented enough at drawing and understand about anatomic proportions, you can learn the art style for a series over time. Becky agrees with this statement, saying it's preferable to show consistency and mastery of one art style than regular or poor abilities in multiple ones. But if you're sticking to one style (your own personal style), then make sure it's appealing and consistent.

![image](./images/unnamed_401.jpg)

When including your character designs, you must show them not only in static poses but in movement also. A good artist is capable of showing some of their character's personality through movement, and that's why Valerio says he values a portfolio where he can see characters with more dynamic poses.

And while a finished character design is the most valued work in a portfolio, you also need to show the creative process behind it. Valerio comments it's helpful to include at least some quick and rough sketches, so a recruiter can see your ability in cleaning up lines and strokes. Finally, this may seem obvious but Becky states that you need to include colored works of art. While it is true that most character design artists only need to work in grayscale or monochromatic schemes, including some colored pieces can make your portfolio look more visually appealing.

## Assignment #2

Using these references [STYLE GUIDE][WDLqqSQEnc] and [MODEL SHEETS][jUaRkemwWU], create a new character that would fit in The Flintstones animated series. More characters to reference [here][VeQzzODQlU].

The show is set in a comical version of a family living in the [Stone Age][ApEIYuHLgy], but has added features and technologies that resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [sitcoms][XdxCKyTgQw] of the era, with the [caveman][skEhnYrFSH] Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts, characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [Bedroc][lILrURLzxl]k. [Dinosaurs][RnbGegpoNv] and other prehistoric creatures are portrayed as co-existing with cavemen, [saber-toothed cats][DwzPmappEk], and [wooly mammoths][ecikHZDWPP], Brontosaurus are all used as pets or tools in everyday life.

The series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [anachronisms][EjAQLxMRrU]; elements belonging or appropriate to a period other than that in which it exists, especially a thing that is conspicuously old-fashioned. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [prehistory][iZqQyoXwtB]. This society takes inspiration from the [suburban sprawl][xoIdWdiCqf] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals. They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them. This depiction is inconsistent, however, on some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline. Also, the stone houses of this society are [cookie-cutter homes][rKOLyUWAzK] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.

The origins of the Hanna-Barbera & Flintstones visual style is found in the history of UPA Studios:

### Expressing Shapes in Design

![image](./images/unnamed_512.jpg)

> Practical Character Design Tips from the Etherington Brothers:

All character designs, no matter how complex they seem, can be broken down into a set of simple shapes. The more through lines there are from one shape to another, the better the shapes combine as a single form. Bold silhouettes come from a symbiotic combination of shapes.

![image](./images/unnamed_787.jpg)

To expand upon the three basic shapes of Round, Box, Triangle - there are these 7 shapes you need to design any character.

![image](./images/unnamed_957.jpg)

If you can draw these shapes, you can draw anything.

There can be squashed and stretched variations of these as well, but these are the main ones used for all foundations of character design. The less shapes at the core of your design, the more iconic it becomes.

![image](./images/unnamed_266.jpg)

Building your design around a primary and secondary shape is very effective.

![image](./images/unnamed_1200.jpg)

Primary / Secondary can be applied to the face as well.

![image](./images/unnamed_168.jpg)

Using one shape in multiple positions and angles allows a more complex design to remain visually balanced.

![image](./images/unnamed_301.jpg)

Sometimes combining shapes inharmoniously can work well.

![image](./images/unnamed_1428.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_535.jpg)

☝️ You can see how these design principles apply to backgrounds and scenery as well ☝️

**Dividing Characters into 3 Sections**.

A great approach for designing a wide range of distinctive characters is to divide them up into three sections.

![image](./images/unnamed_1023.jpg)

1. Begin by randomly choosing the height of each section as either short, medium or tall.
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_430.jpg)
2. Next, randomly make the width of each section narrow, medium, or wide.
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_121.jpg)
3. If we just draw these as standing boxes we can already see the range of body proportions.
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_315.jpg)
4. Connect the shapes using either curved or angled lines.
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_1101.jpg)
5. With your proportions in place, draw small thumbnail sketches of characters within them. Try lots of designs for each shape, it always works!
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_402.jpg)

The 3-shape approach is so effective, you can use it to take one character and generate endless variations! Let's start with this simple robot...

![image](./images/unnamed_1414.jpg)

There's no end to the options, just change the width and height of the three sections!

![image](./images/unnamed_1422.jpg)

Although the 3-shape process is just one of many approaches to character design.

It also helps you to better analyze other characters' proportions.

![image](./images/unnamed_1226.jpg)

Notice the effect on the feel of the character when you cluster the main volume around different areas.

### Proportions

When it comes to a character\'s age in comparison to their head size - it can become quite arbitrary and puzzling. When examining proportions and their relationship to a character's age - it\'s all contextual and relative to the universe they reside in. For example, what do all these male cartoon characters have in common?

![image](./images/unnamed_967.jpg)

**They\'re all 10!**

A different kind of test: How good do you think you are at discerning age from a line-up?

![image](./images/unnamed_762.jpg)

The top row kids fall into a younger category ranging from 2 to 6. The bottom row kids range 7 to 9.

![image](./images/unnamed_1184.jpg)

How design choices are made, like height and face shape, is all about the surrounding characters and environment.

Their age is easier to specify by comparison.

Another fun way to compare proportions is to match the character heights up.

It puts the head-size into perspective.

> Why Batman The Animated Series Changed its Character Designs - Writer, Paul Dini Explains the Controversy:

Few adaptations are as beloved as Batman: The Animated Series, however, the series\' decision to update character designs in between its original run and The New Batman Adventures is one aspect that did not sit right with fans. Timmverse legend and Harley Quinn co-creator Paul Dini has revealed what led to the polarizing changes.

\"I think that was all from the desires of \[BTAS co-creator\] Bruce Timm and the other artists and directors to vary the look of the characters somewhat between iterations,\" Dini explains. \"Partially it was to make it look a little more like the new look of the Superman animated series, but also to just experiment and refine a few things.\"

![image](./images/unnamed_406.jpg)

Some of the design changes were warmly received by fans, such as the choice to have an older version of Dick Grayson portraying his popular alter ego Nightwing, and giving Scarecrow a creepy new visage that even included a frayed noose around his neck. Others, though, didn\'t go over as well. Specifically, the choices to give Joker hollowed-out, black eyes, Catwoman abnormally chalky skin, and Bane\'s new mask left some fans cold.

Being a veteran of the industry since the 1980s, Dini found the fan reaction to the design changes a bit odd, especially given that character refining has been a common practice in animation for decades. \"That tradition of visual reinvention has always been a part of Warner Bros Animation,\" Dini stated. \"No one ever asks about Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck getting visually redefined over the years, it was just something the directors did over time.\"

There is also a commercial reason for animation studios to change the look of their characters. Given that the majority of revenue surrounding animation properties comes from merchandising rights for toys, new designs give companies new editions to place on store shelves.

Starring Kevin Conroy, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Mark Hamill, Batman: The Animated Series debuted in 1992, and stands as one of the most acclaimed adaptations of comic books to another medium. The series won four Emmy Awards and ran from 1992 to 1995, with follow-up series The New Batman Adventures airing from 1997 to 1999, for a total of 109 episodes.

Construction lines in animation are the guidelines sketched in to show the angle and forms of all the shapes that make up the design and poses, they often look like crosshairs on the body parts.

You'll start to notice some familiar patterns while exploring more and more different design styles. See how many can share some similar traits and features:

![image](./images/unnamed_1715.png)

### Contrasting Shapes

One vastly important aspect of all design is Contrast - it improves your character art by providing the viewer with two (or more) things that play off one another, simply by being different.

_Contrast = Interest_.

This applies to almost every aspect of art, but it's especially important when we dive into character design.

![image](./images/unnamed_1108.jpg)

Draw-over notes and feedback from a director:

![image](./images/unnamed_803.png)

Unique Shapes + Contrast in Individual Characters:

Designing characters around base shapes for contrast and appeal is a time-tested tradition among animators and illustrators.

![Po_Kung_Fu_Panda](./images/unnamed_1228.jpg)

Take a look at this image of Po, for a few great examples. First, his color scheme is classic contrast: Black and white. There is no greater contrast than these opposing forces. Look deeper into his design and you'll see a myriad of contrast from shape. As you can see, the design of the pose itself is a factor in the appeal and clarity of the character and its attitude.

![po_shapes](./images/unnamed_1392.png)

He is made up of many circles overall, all these elements work together to create a visually interesting character. If he was made entirely of one shape it would not be nearly as interesting. Yet at the same time, there is an overall form to adhere to rather than placing things sporadically or randomly. His overall pose is a triangle, which you'll see repeated in many of the promo images and poses Dreamworks puts the character in. Everything about his design speaks of **heavy**, **friendly**, **solid**.

**Unique Shapes + Contrast in a Cast of Characters**.

It doesn't stop there, though! Not only should characters have contrast in their individual designs, there should be contrast among the whole cast!

![image](./images/unnamed_1606.png)

These rough drawings from the Aladdin sheet are a perfect example. You see the characters each have a variety of base shapes showing how they contrast nicely against each other. Providing a lot of visual interest, appeal, individuality, and insight on each character's core personalities.

In a cast of characters, you want to work with contrasting and complementary shapes:

Here's designs for incidental background characters from the series _Mike Tyson Mysteries_. This is just an example showing how various body types and costuming needs to be constructed to populate the world your cast of characters will reside in, notice how variations on similar body types, assortment of costumes, a diversity of head shapes, and subtle differences in proportions are used:

![image](./images/unnamed_475.jpg)

When studying how to re-create any particular design style, discover and analyze the structure of the anatomy. For example, Kim Possible follows this design language:

![image](./images/unnamed_1369.jpg)

It's not only the pattern of shapes that make up the body parts, but the characters' graphic style as a whole. Practice with really loose and quick roughs, to figure out the forms, arrangement of [shapes][IsNRYijRnx] and what techniques are needed to adapt your drawings to the intended design style.

For Kim Possible style:

Vary your shapes and proportions:

![image](./images/unnamed_593.jpg)

Vary the size and shape, using Exclamation Points!

![image](./images/unnamed_034.png)

The exclamation point method is a great construction tool to block in shapes effectively and easily, it can work well on detailed anatomy but most commonly seen in more graphically represented characters like these. The exclamation point represents the ribs and pelvis.

Although the Simpsons characters and their appearances have become a familiar part of our everyday lives now, it's not hard to imagine that it must have taken people quite a bit of time to get used to, when these characters first came on-air with their bright yellow skin tone. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening has spoken about what it felt like to finally arrive at a decision, as he was choosing his characters' skin color.

Apparently, Groening's main motivation was simple: He wanted to make the Springfield residents look memorable and interesting. With all of the other animated series on the air, Groening felt it was important to make sure that Homer, as well as his family and neighbors, stood out from the crowd. Although he considered other colors, yellow was the one that shone through in the end.

"This is the answer! When you're flicking through channels, and a flash of yellow goes by, you'll know you're watching The Simpsons," Groening once stated.

### Character Dimension

Advice from [Sam Nielson][yozKarXPSc]:

Character dimension is a concept I've found very useful when striving for more appealing character designs. I'm not talking about the literal dimension of forms, but how to give the characters the appropriate amount of personality and interest relative to their screen time in the story. There are a lot of theories on this, so I'm picking the pieces from those theories that best apply to character design.

This idea of character dimension is best explained with contrast. There are four different levels of dimension as it relates to visual design, with the highest level being a three-dimensional character.

![Characterdimension_BitDiagram.jpg](./images/unnamed_656.jpg)

The first level of depth is a "bit" character. Think of a bit as a single point in space, with no dimension. A bit character displays only one character attribute---usually meant to fulfill a single purpose as that character stands in the spotlight onscreen for a very brief time. Here's an example of a bit part: the hopelessly nerdy character.

![SamNielson_Characterdimension_Bit.jpg](./images/unnamed_065.jpg)

To keep this character aligned with that bit part, I tried to make everything on him give a "sad sack" feeling---droopy, soft, and ineffective. This character is understood in his entirety almost immediately, which makes him useful for brief moments with no introduction. A character like this can still act against type in that instant, but that action must be understood quickly in context of that simple and clear character bit, or the contrasting attributes will only create confusion. The weakness of a bit character is that after this character serves his momentary purpose, he will become insufficiently interesting\* for extra time in the spotlight.

(\*As a side note, I should mention that any character design can be enriched through great writing and animation. Appealing and appropriate characters can make great writing and animation better, but even the best character design will struggle without the other two.)

![Characterdimension_1Diagram.jpg](./images/unnamed_344.jpg)

Imagine taking that single point in space, that surface character attribute, and stretching it into a line. Now you have two poles possible with contrasting components, or a one-dimensional character. The contrasting attributes here are different from a bit character acting against type, because this character may be seen at varying points along that line throughout the film (while a bit character acting against type will always act the same). My example of a one-dimensional character adds aggressive confidence to a hopelessly nerdy character.

![SamNielson_Characterdimension_1.jpg](./images/unnamed_524.jpg)

I communicated the two poles of this character's single dimension by contrasting gesture, expression, and shape language against his easily understood role or type. You can also do this with contrasting costume decisions, color scheme, and other elements. Usually, the one-dimensional character is defined by "what," meaning both poles are expressions of how that character fills his role in the world. One-dimensional characters remain interesting for longer, and they can even have simple character arcs, but they lack any real depth.

![Characterdimension_2Diagram.jpg](./images/unnamed_480.jpg)

Adding one more dimension to a character creates depth and a lot more interest. This second dimension is usually defined by "why?", or the character's history and motivations. Expanding on the example character, who now has one dimension that goes between hopelessly nerdy all the way to confident villain, but also adds a second dimension that shows a little bit of the inner demons driving him; a life of bullying and misfortune.

![Characterdimension_2.jpg](./images/unnamed_839.jpg)

In this case I imagined the opposing poles of his second dimension are his need to be someone---to have power over his life, contrasted with his complete helplessness in the context of the strength and socially-driven world he has always lived in. I used recent fight-related injuries and the expression to suggest the character's history and the hardening of his motivations. Typically, the visual language for history and motivation is going to be a second read, meaning that the first dimension is the first stuff the audience sees, but is then modified with a closer look at the character. A character with this much complexity needs enough screen time to show all combinations of the four extremes of these two dimensions; otherwise he collapses down to a one-dimensional character in the story, in which case the audience will feel dissatisfaction and an intuitive need to know more about him than his screen time allows, because of the amount of conflict the character suggests. That said, even if I'm designing a one-dimensional character, I will often explore the second dimension story-wise because understanding the backstory and inner demons can suggest interesting expressions of that single dimension that I wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

![Characterdimension_3Diagram.jpg](./images/unnamed_487.jpg)

The third dimension is the "who" of the character; and it is the hardest one to quantify in the visual parts of the character design. This dimension demands a lot of screen time, as the character now needs to go through the hero's journey. A protagonist, the love interest, a sidekick, or even the main villain can be three-dimensional, so long as there's enough time to unravel all three dimensions.

![SamNielson_Characterdimension_3.jpg](./images/unnamed_1192.jpg)

This character starts the story being defined by WHAT he is (the hopelessly nerdy kid bordering on supervillainy), then the story would explore WHY he has become that way (inner demons of social and physical abuse by peers he wants to impress), but to gain the third dimension, then the story must test the limits of that character beyond the surface attributes and internal desires or motivations. In other words, you can't know WHO this character is until you have seen the things that outwardly define him stripped away, and see the choices he makes when facing the resulting desolation of his failure. In visual design terms, you cannot show this journey all at once! But you can show the potential for that character to change. More nuance in shape language, a little baby face bias, more thoughtful, vulnerable eyes, and even a less "set" demeanor can help cue the audience that this character is not yet done with his journey. Unlike previous dimensions, you can sometimes apply three-dimensional design to a character in a two-dimensional role without frustrating the audience; so long as the suggestion of potential-for-change doesn't compete with the role the character plays in the story.

Is it possible to have a character with more dimensions than this? Yes; even four and five-dimensional characters can work in a story, but fitting that extra information into a design is very difficult! My experience is that the first and second dimensions can be layered into a character after the initial design, so your design process doesn't need to include all this information from the start, so long as you can get your art director to be patient with the exploration of those dimensions. Character dimension is less about which is good, better, or best; and more about designing characters that are appropriate for their roles in the story. I hope this proves to be a helpful tool to other aspiring character designers out there!

### Explore Gesture Drawing

One way to accelerate the growth of your drawing skills and observational skills is through gesture drawing.

What a Gesture should be:

- Loose
- Fluid
- Tells a Story / Conveys a Mood
- Don't be a slave to the model - Push the poses

![image](./images/unnamed_1697.png)

7 Principles of Gestures:

- Line of Action
- Shapes
- Silhouette
- Space
- Exaggeration
- Extrapolation
- Story

![image](./images/unnamed_311.png)

Line of Action

- What is the MAIN IDEA of the Pose?
- How do I represent that idea with a LINE?
- Show the main idea of the pose with 1-2 lines
- It's a base for your drawing
- Dynamic poses = angles and harsh/straight lines
- Relaxed poses = curves and soft lines

![image](./images/unnamed_1351.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1350.png)

Shape

- Represent the pose in a simple shape
- Dynamic pose = Obtuse Triangle, Extreme Rhombus-shape
- Relaxed pose = Semicircle, Relaxed Peanut-shape

![image](./images/unnamed_507.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1718.png)

Silhouette

- Needs to be clear/readable
- Should be able to tell what every part of the body is doing

![image](./images/unnamed_582.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_690.png)

Space

- The model in relation to 3D space
- Avoid always placing the feet on the same plane

![image](./images/unnamed_859.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1703.png)

Exaggeration

- Avoid a literal translation of the pose
- Push the pose
- Communicate the idea, not the pose

![image](./images/unnamed_164.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1121.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_206.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1335.jpg)

Extrapolation

- Draw animals or [alternate characters][QuxIKBXHxf] from the model using the same pose
- Push past what you see for the idea/emotion

![image](./images/unnamed_1424.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1266.png)

Story

- Tell a story with the pose
- What is the main idea of the Pose?
- How do I best communicate it?

![image](./images/unnamed_1684.png)

\[The Science of Drawing\] vs \[The Soul of Drawing\]

- Anatomy
- Emotions
- Light
- Feelings
- Proportion
- Ideas
- Technique

![image](./images/unnamed_251.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_757.png)

Combine both Concepts:

\[Science of the Soul\]

- Draftsmanship vs Vitality
- Tedium does not equal Sophistication
- Realism does not equal Quality

How to do a Gesture drawing:

- Observe the pose for 10 seconds
- Try to find the main idea/feeling of the pose
- Grab a loose basic drawing or a small thumbnail
- Push that pose
- No one will know you changed it!
- Emphasize the pose, don't always make it dynamic
- Use the model as a jumping off point
- Go with your first impression - follow your instincts

### Structural Drawing

There have been many well-known authors of anatomy and figure drawing books, they're fantastic resources to find and research through - masters such as [Loomis][PPclsbPkPu], [Bridgman][qXvQRdMpnk], [Tiner][qbEzZYACkK], [Hamm][BppTkaupzu], and [Sterling][VwbfkVtcFk], just to name a few. They all have their own styles for how structural anatomy drawing should be approached, there's lots to learn from all of them.

Here's a breakdown of shape design combinations by [Nicolas Rix][ZjFKdtQrPT]:

![image](./images/unnamed_495.jpg)

![image](./images/unnamed_526.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1302.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_252.jpg)

Grab artwork or photos from online, or pause on videos, take a screenshot - bring it into your drawing software and DRAW OVER it to FIND the structure, it can be fun and a great learning experience:

![image](./images/unnamed_038.png)

There's many ways to approach how to make breakdowns:

![image](./images/unnamed_1254.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_887.png)

Doing a character study like these can help you see where the patterns are in the anatomy that is unique to that property's style, here's an example of a breakdown of the various shapes, proportions and body types from Total Drama Island:

![image](./images/unnamed_1624.png)

Structural anatomy is one of the most basic and important aspects to learn about character design - it can be broken down many different ways, here's just a few examples:

![image](./images/unnamed_543.jpg)

![image](./images/unnamed_1169.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_883.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1436.png)

Your drawing skills, your drawing speed, and your work ethic, are your primary tools that will make you a valued employee in the field of character design. Creativity and Style develop naturally and slowly over time. Your level of draftsmanship in figure drawing is something you will work on during your entire career. Even though you'll never directly use the practice drawings you do with figure drawing in your work, the underlying skills it develops will increase your knowledge and abilities when it comes to design.

### Advice for the Aspiring Character Designer

- **Practice Turn Arounds**
  - Because turns are so important to the TV animation [pipeline][otEfkQBVaV], knowing how to rotate a character properly is essential in showing off your skills and how to be useful in the design team.
- **Be Familiar with Mouth Charts**
  - Less integral than turns since most shows teach you their in-house system for mouth charts, but researching what the standard mouth shapes are and memorizing them is a good way to prepare, this way you only need to adapt them to the style you will be doing them for.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_979.png)
- **Draw Animals**
  - Nothing really shows your draftsmanship skills quite like drawing a horse or giraffe. Practice drawing animals because inevitably, there will be a time when you have to draw one as a character designer. See if you can stylize animal anatomy in different ways.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_111.png)
  - By Ben Balistreri
- **Hoard Images**
  - Professional character designers usually have massive collections of photo references of things that inspire them. Save photos of outfits, hairdos, people, poses, images of models sheets and sketches from various artists and styles \-- Anything that sparks your imagination. Keep them organized in lots of folders.
- **Keep your Layers Organized**
  - In TV animation, one Photoshop file is passed from artist to artist through the pipeline so a messy layering/labeling system can be a nightmare for whoever touches your file next. Always strive to be organized when setting up your photoshop files so that you are kind to whoever has to deal with it next.
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1568.png)
  - By Jerimiah Alcorn
- **Work on Speed**
  - The entire character design industry can be summed up in 4 words: **GOOD DESIGNS, ON TIME**
  - This is NEVER easy. The demand for quality and quantity on a relentless deadline-based weekly schedule, will ALWAYS be challenging. Practice managing your time, and try different techniques and tools to help you stay focused and on track. Practice drawing more efficiently, work on saving sites and resources that are fast to use to have at your fingertips for searching for references. Organize your own folders of saved imagery and website links archived and easy to access.
- **Stay Healthy**
  - Here is a document about how to prevent repetitive stress disorder and other injuries that can happen from drawing for too many hours, and how to prevent harm to your body from working at a computer for long periods of time. It comes with some advice on exercising, nutrition, sleep, and how to manage burn-out: [Health & Wellness][HQveAMDJDa]
  - ![image](./images/unnamed_1440.jpg)
- **Just Keep on Drawing**
  - More than other positions in TV animation, a character designer needs to really know how to DRAW. To what level of draftsmanship? This depends on the type of show, but being a strong illustrator with a wide array of skillsets will only make you a more desirable character artist... and will ultimately help you maintain longevity in your career. Stay motivated, start doing the work, become focused, don't overthink everything, choose action over everything else, [watch this!][TKNYZlVJFP]

> "When you just grab the instrument, keyboard, or pen, you just need to start, just do something, anything, you'll realize it happens almost by itself, you become the conduit for that creative energy that was waiting to flow out. You keep your ego out of it, it happens on its own, it just will pour out of you, but you need to get started first. When it comes to art, you can't wait to be ready, you can't tell yourself you're not prepared and not ready to start, you just need to start, right away, no matter what." \- Robert Rodriguez

- **How to be more efficient:**
  - **Drawing** - Develop your drawing skills to create compelling visuals and show off the various styles you can do
  - **Research** - Find and collect references from all types of sources to find inspiration
  - **Storytelling** - Understand how your characters fit into the narrative and how they relate to each other
  - **Digital tools** - Practice on the software; Photoshop, Illustrator, Clip Studio Paint and Procreate
  - **Keep learning** - Make sure to collect as many [books][cBXriXEnOl] as you can, along with any well-established [anatomy books][gOBjsxgUJI]

### Build Your Portfolio

Strong character design portfolios usually have some key features:

Show you have a range of styles - especially in TV animation, chances are you will need to bounce between several different types of shows with different styles.

A good way to show your breadth as a designer is to have 3 vastly different styles at the top of your portfolio.

For Example:

1. Your personal style/comfort zone
2. Super cartoony/simplified/stylized
3. Very anatomically-accurate/realistic

TV animation has designers who know how to become chameleons. A good strategy for showcasing your design chops is to create one main project in your comfort zone style. Showcase your handle on Emotion and Storytelling and Draftsmanship by using a pre-existing property and create a new character in your own native style. Create character lineups, poses, expressions, vignettes and scenarios, showing their personalities and how they interact.

![image](./images/unnamed_536.png)

Consider showing your preliminary sketches and explorations of different potential takes of a character. The other 2 styles (super cartoony and realistic/anatomical) don't need to be of the same project, just nice lineups of characters to show you can switch styles readily. The specific design languages don't matter, those are just choices to make and to stick to for the specific personality and intentions behind the character's design.

Practice your techniques to adjust your drawing style to suit various shows: [Inspire Multiple Designs From One Idea][uSlxSmuzro]

![image](./images/unnamed_759.png) ![image](./images/unnamed_689.jpg)

For one or two characters in your portfolio - show your progression stages, employers like to see your thought process:

![image](./images/unnamed_620.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_834.jpg)

There's no one correct way to present your characters in your portfolio, only some principles to follow to make your designs clear in your layouts to make things visually appealing. When thinking about how to present your characters, follow the patterns other designers take - keep it simple and inviting. A common way of displaying your work is to combine the turnarounds with head angles/expressions and a full-figure pose off to the side like this:

![image](./images/unnamed_827.jpg)

Displaying a wide range of designs, shows your versatility.

![image](./images/unnamed_337.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_083.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_423.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_722.jpg)

Variations of the same type of template is fun and easy to make:

Create an account with one of these; [artstation][ssWsKlrGpZ], [behance][raMHSkACkF], [carbonmade][JTbDQHijRx], [myportfolio][ULfoZBCuab], [wix][xOIowyRieB],[blogger][nVDmIViFgl],[weebly][yrEnVHXdPB],[dribbble][TGQpdlegsz],[format][eSAzrKjXXD], [google][GbpPTKcOoh], or any other free portfolio-making site of your choice. There\'s dozens to choose from, they all do the same thing, research through them, find the one that you like best, and sign up for it. What you\'ll do with it is very simple: you don\'t need anything fancy; you\'re just displaying your work, and it's good to show some versions with your exploration sketches, rough pass, clean lineart and some color. The important thing is to have your **contact info** visible everywhere, to keep your site simple, easy-to-navigate, and only having your very **best work** on display.

Have at least 10 different character design turnarounds (4pt, or more) in your portfolio. Show some variety in your progress and design packs: rough explorations with clean or colored works, only show your very best. Showing your process helps employers see what your thoughts are while creating and they always appreciate that.

View these portfolios as solid examples of what YOU can achieve after a few years of experience! It's easy to be intimidated by the refined styles of these pro illustrators and designers and the sleek layout of their portfolios \-- These high standards take years to slowly build up and achieve. But remember: the quality of your designs will depend on the time you spent on them and how much research and preparation you've done beforehand. If you are worried about having no production experience \-- it still truly doesn't matter...

Your portfolio is meant to display your vast potential to your employers. If you DO have experience, then your résumé (LinkedIn) can show off your list of jobs and skill sets, along with listings of what productions you've worked on in the past, including any personal projects and courses you've taken, no matter how small the tasks and work you've done, include EVERYTHING.

- 👉 [Portfolio Tips by Laura Price][OjabRIlkaT]
- 👉 [Portfolio Tips by Jackie Droujko][IEkFvZGpqY]

Your portfolio site should always be focused on keeping the very best of your designs on display. Always think about clear and simple page layouts, and indicate you are more than willing to receive and complete their design tests when submitting your applications. Your skills, your dedication, and work ethic will ALWAYS matter most to employers.

If you're showcasing samples of your character designs created from the exercises off this site or just your own original creations (or a bit of both), know that your portfolio site is primarily there to present your diversity in the styles you are capable of producing and the potential you have at being a solid worker. Your portfolio needs to show your range as an artist, keep things simple and straight-forward, remember, the bigger range of different styles you show, the more employable it will make you, but only show your most high quality work.

![image](./images/unnamed_026.jpg)

If you happen to be humble, timid, stoic, shy, soft spoken, introverted, or nervous \-- that's totally fine! A studio head, talent recruiter, employer, director, or producer will always want you more for your skills, ideas, resourcefulness, creativity and artistic abilities above all else. Be aware of the fact that the odds of anyone stumbling upon your portfolio by random chance are very, very slim. You need to reach out to studios, their talent recruitment person, HR person, line producer, operations manager, whoever it may be, and give them the link to your work and ask if they have a test for you to complete, or any jobs you could do for them.

![image](./images/unnamed_478.jpg)

Skill and methodology evolves over time, be patient. Know that everyone draws, sketches and designs differently and in their own way. Even with a short résumé and little-to-no experience \> don't be discouraged! You can apply for other types of design work within the [studio pipeline][gFISdSpAOT] to get started and to get your experience points built up; Prop Designer, Character Clean-up Artist, Character Design Assistant, or Design Revisionist are just some of the alternatives and common first-jobs you can get in the design department of an animation studio. Ask them about how to start off as a junior artist or a design intern - they're all excellent ways to get your foot-in-the-door, it's all about how to get your start, convince them to give you a chance, to complete some tests to show your skills or to have you on a short internship. See advice [here][HuQyQilyGM] for those wanting to break into video game design.

Then it's your responsibility to do the best work you can as fast as you can, show them you have some potential to grow, learn, to be helpful and useful to their design team at the very least. While you are waiting for work, keep drawing and keep adding to your portfolio!

To add a bit of variety in your portfolio you can create casts of characters as a group together...

Try this! \> Design a family portrait: **6 characters** (full body) - Mother, Father, Daughter, Son, Grandmother, and house Pet (dog, cat, iguana, or anything). Choices in their attitudes/expressions will help to define their moods in this moment. Are they all happy, sad, angry, bored? A mixture of all these? Their hair and clothing choices are important in depicting what type of family they are and what time period they may be from. Pose them as a group together. Have fun with it.

![image](./images/unnamed_1270.jpg)

For extra effort, add more family members, and in color!

![image](./images/unnamed_302.jpg)

Try this! \> Design a classroom of kids: Pick any design style you're most comfortable with, and create a school classroom group photo, showcasing **16 characters** of 2nd grade kids. This will have you think about what their distinctly unique personalities, clothing, hairstyles, postures and expressions are.

![image](./images/unnamed_938.jpg)

Try this! \> Design a group from a fantasy roleplaying adventure game: **4 characters** - a Barbarian, a Thief (Rogue), a Wizard (Sorcerer), and a Warrior (Fighter). Add more if you wish, like a Bard, a Knight, a Ranger, a Cleric, or a Monk. Pose them together as a team.

> Color and texture is not necessary, but a welcome bonus.

Including pieces like these add originality to your portfolio!

Exploring how your character would look at various ages can help you discover certain aspects about them and have you see your character in a different way, which can help your visual development process for your personal work. A nice exercise to produce for your portfolio would be to pick ANY one character, from your own creation or not, and re-draw them at **various ages**. As an example - showing them as a baby, toddler, child, teenager, adult, older adult and elder. This can be a great 7-stage progression of character designs to showcase:

![image](./images/unnamed_060.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1404.jpg)

Suggested ages you could draw the same character at: 1, 5, 10, 16, 30, 60, 90

#### When can you update your portfolio with your new work?

The question is often raised about WHEN should you post the designs in your portfolio you've made for a client or studio?

You've worked on a contract for a few months, the production has come to an end, but there's still many months, possibly over a year before the designs you've made are animated, completed, and broadcast/streamed to the public.

In nearly ALL cases, executives and studios do not allow the release of any visual material (online or anywhere) before all the episodes have come out. Therefore, unfortunately you cannot post your work in a portfolio update or social media posts until the animated property has been released. Afterwards you're good to publish your work and update the online portfolio.

For your own personal projects and characters of your own creation, of course, update your portfolio with these as soon as you can.

#### Copyrights

To dispel any myths about the dangers of copyright laws for what you are permitted to place in your portfolio - here\'s a breakdown of the two possible scenarios\...

This is YOUR own drawings of a new character in a few **established styles** from four different animated series:

![image](./images/unnamed_1408.png)

This is based upon the character [Walter White][DThjTglsCu] from the live-action series Breaking Bad.

And this is a drawing of a known **established character** in YOUR own style:

![image](./images/unnamed_1323.png)

A re-imagined version of the character [Homer Simpson][CJXHucmITH].

Both are NOT infringing on any copyrights.

According to copyright law: drawing a known character in your own style is generally considered acceptable as long as you significantly alter the original character\'s design (or appearance if it's based upon an existing actor/celebrity/person), adding your own unique creative elements, and not simply copying the core features and appearance of a copyrighted character; essentially, you are protected by the \"derivative work\" and [Fair Use][MtzumxGEQk] concept, where you\'re expressing the original idea in a substantially different way through your artistic interpretation; and there are no laws preventing you from drawing new characters resembling a pre existing established style of design for any intellectual property of any kind.

Another aspect of design that can be used by anyone in any way are [Public Domain][lybDwdADIz] characters. Examples are: Robin Hood, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur, Zorro, John Carter, Frankenstein\'s Monster, King Kong, Pinocchio, Hercules, and Alice in Wonderland.Public domain characters are fictional characters that are not protected by copyright, meaning anyone can use them freely without permission from the creator or another rightsholder. This happens when the copyright protection for a work expires, typically a few decades after the creator's death. Once in the public domain, these characters, along with other elements of the story, become open to public use.

Some studios require you to fill out a form on their website, this way it always goes to the same talent recruiting / HR person on staff. Where they can process the intake of applications and will be forwarded to the relevant department heads, studio director, or the creative lead, who can ascertain the skill sets displayed in the portfolio. This process will then have them determine to hire you, or place you on a waitlist, or have a test delivered to you, to bring you to the next phase of potentially being hired.

![image](./images/unnamed_865.png)

Filling out and submitting those forms are easy. There's usually a spot to fill out for a body of text, where you can insert or type out a cover letter or brief introduction about yourself. In either case, if you seem enthusiastic, straight-to-the-point, open to start anytime and anywhere and eager to help them out, it can go a long way to reveal your solid work ethic and positive attitude.

Here's an example of what that cover letter (email message) from you could look like:

> I\'m sending this email to apply for the Character Design position at your studio. As I\'ve just recently finished my portfolio that you can see here (insert your website URL), I\'m very eager to start gaining some real-world experience in the animation industry. I\'ve been a huge fan of animation and cartoons my whole life, and I have been drawing my own characters and developing my own stories since I was a child.
>
> This passion has only grown as I\'ve gotten older, as cartoons have begun to expand into a vast array of different genres and are constantly exploring more and more concepts and ideas. I\'m currently a massive fan of series such as (insert name of an animated series). The use of color in the character designs and their costumes truly evoke a strong sense of what the characters' struggles & personalities are and how they fit in their environments. I also adore the art and animation style of (insert name of another animated series), its unique qualities within the series\' universe, such as its loose regulations for physical consistency within the characters - while still maintaining its own set of logic and rules within the world and show itself. At the same time, it seamlessly blends the cartoony style of the characters with its detailed backgrounds.
>
> Since my college course has ended, I have been keeping myself occupied by expanding my knowledge in (Harmony, Photoshop & Blender). I\'ve been teaching myself the principles of designing characters in a variety of different styles. It\'s for this reason I would absolutely love the opportunity to work at (insert studio name here). I feel I should also note that I'm willing to take any character design test as well, to show you where my skill sets are, and how quickly I can learn. I would love a short internship at your studio, or any junior design position like prop design and character design assistance, or even contribute to tasks like finishing turnarounds or doing clean-up on designs and poses.
>
> Thank you kindly for the opportunity.
>
> (Your Name)

This is just an example, and you should customize and personalize this template to make it fit to your personal preferences, along with the work and parameters of the job you're asking about. Replace the names of the shows, the name of the studio you're writing to, and the software names with your own. After you've gotten your first job or two, you'll never need cover letters again, your portfolio will speak for itself. But this letter gives you an idea of how it can be kept short-and-sweet, while showing your appreciation for the craft. It increases your chances when you demonstrate that you're an impassioned nerd about the art of character design!

![image](./images/unnamed_104.png)

### Studio Design Tests

After applying to a studio by sending them the online link to your **character design portfolio**, you may receive a design test from them so that they can better determine where your skill sets are and to see if you can adapt to their production's art style. You'll be given reference and you'll need to create a small cast of new characters (or a turnaround for a single character) that matches the art direction provided to you. In all cases, whether you are given a test to do over a few days, or if they hire you on-the-spot, you'll need to sign an NDA. These are Non-Disclosure Agreements, this is a common practice and understanding that you cannot divulge any information about the property you are working on to anyone that isn't working on the property, before or during production (sometimes even a while after production has ended). And you cannot place samples of the work you are doing (or have done), online, or in your portfolio, until the production has been broadcast, streamed, published, released, or made public.

Your ability to match the style of the property while showing your originality, accuracy, consistency, and creativity will determine if you get accepted on the team. Make sure you know what the parameters are; is color required, how many views to draw, and what the deadline is. Exceed their expectations by drawing clean, keeping the characters alive, expressive, distinct, non-ambiguous, and instantly-recognizable, they may also want to see your roughs and thought-process, so save all your sketches too, include your progression in the design submission.

by Ray Santos

These tests are usually not paid for, so no need to ask them, and they are structured to test your creativity & resourcefullness. It's engineered to see how you would handle a specific kind of assignment, and to see if your style (and interpretation of their style) is a good fit for the production. It's essentially acting like a **job interview**, like when there's try-outs for athletes to see if they qualify to be in the competition or become a member of the team. Similar to auditions for actors to perform a certain part in a play.

Suggestion: If they don't provide a deadline, then complete the test within 2 days. How promptly you return the artwork is a factor for how they'll determine your skill sets, unless the style is difficult or they're asking for lots of artwork as part of the requirements, showing your commitment by responding quickly with results will go a long way. Do not compromise quality, if you feel you can make the designs look better if you had more time, then take that time to improve the test.

If you're hired, they send you the contract with the details outlined on the specifics of the job, along with a start date!

Sometimes a design test will consist of designing several versions of a single concept, like when the director wants to see 10 iterations of the same character. For example, here the design test is to design a Mailman in the style of Loud House:

![image](./images/unnamed_569.jpg)

And here, to design Lori's Boyfriend:

### Inside The Studio

Here's a Survival Guide on what to expect once you're hired as a character designer for an animated series.

Staying inspired is a big part of the job. In addition to having a firm grasp on the artistic and technical aspects of the work, there are also some mental challenges that one must control in order to remain effective.

Usually a character designer's job has lots of work and responsibility to it. It's not an easy role, it can be a very very fun job, but it can be very difficult and demanding work as well. It's one of the first roles to be hired on the production once the world is developed, the characters are conceived, and the story is written.

Topics covered in this chapter include: finding the right amount of ego, conquering inconsistent progress, managing the ebb and flow from show-to-show, navigating studio politics, working with casting, catching and missing breaks on a production, making the most out of every opportunity, and letting go of emotional attachment to the work while still getting the best designs you can. Let's get started...

#### Attitude

The most common advice on attitude is to have a positive one.

This is, of course, easier said than done. It's normal to have bad days, we're only human. It's what you do with both the good and bad days that can make or break your success and overall fulfillment in the job.

Steadiness is the key and a proactive attitude is your best weapon. Recognize the bad days, reflect on what made them bad, then let them go. Embrace the good days, reflect on what made them good. The nuggets you glean can keep you extremely motivated.

The scale of the successes and failures change but there will be both.

1. **Successes:**
   - Getting picked up on a show
   - Nailing your designs
   - Making a big contribution to a worthwhile project
1. **Failures:**
   - Your characters get revised over and over
   - Missing deadlines
   - Characters reassigned
   - Not having a contract picked up

How you react to your circumstances says as much about you as a designer as your work. The best advice is to try to stay humble after success and to try and reset after failure. Not every success or failure is a representation of your abilities. You may struggle on a turn-around view, a whole character concept, or even for an entire show. It does not mean you are not a good designer. You may just be working on something that lays outside your sensibilities.

On the flip side, you may kick ass and work your way up into a top position on one show, but not hold that position when moved to the next. You can never expect special treatment because of your achievements and don't be bummed if you don't get it. Try to maintain a steady professional attitude and this will speak volumes.

Ironically the FIRST portfolio you create to get your FIRST job is your most important one, and yet it will be the WORST one of your career. Your first portfolio is the one made to show your potential, so that employers see that you have the basic raw skills needed to start off in their studio, and at the least, to be contributing to their productions in significant ways. Once you've finished your first contract on your first show, most of your portfolio will be replaced with the NEW work you've done. After each production after that, you keep adding and replacing things to your portfolio, and with each project being completed, you make yourself more valuable.

![image](./images/unnamed_1014.png)

As you can see from this chart, the factors that are most important for Getting Hired versus Staying Hired, can change quite a bit. When you are gunning for your first job, you don't have any production experience yet, so your speed is unknown, they don't know how fast you are, and YOU don't even know how fast you can be, until you're put to the test. The quality of your FIRST portfolio will be weak compared to the one you'll have after only a few months of production work, but it's all you have to go by, and that's fine, you have no reputation (good or bad) and your speed is unknown to them (and yourself).

Your attitude and work ethic are also not known to any employer. So first impressions are important, and the people hiring you are aware of the fact that you are new to the process, so they are looking for diversity in your skill range and on the stylistic and artistic level, able to offer some creativity in your designs and accuracy within the turn-around samples you provide. It shows that SPEED isn't a factor until you get hired, with that said, if you take a VERY long time in completing a design test, then that would affect their decision in hiring you, of course. So assuming you don't take more than a few days to complete the design test, then your quality and creativity is what will impress them most.

> (\\\_/)
> ( •\_•)
> /\>🍿\<

Once you are hired, your attitude is actually MORE important to keeping yourself employed than all other factors. Your quality and speed will increase naturally as time goes on, you'll develop your work-habits reputation in this way. But if you maintain a positive attitude, help others with their work, meet your deadlines, make yourself easy to work with, ask questions, be consistent, stay reliable, offer resourceful solutions to design problems, and always show a steady growth in your skill level... you'll stay employed forever.

What will matter MORE than your overall quality and speed, is your positive attitude, your work ethic and your steady rate of improvement (even if it is only small amounts over time). These will increase your chances of staying hired, getting promoted, or getting transferred over to the next new production as contracts end and new ones begin.

![image](./images/unnamed_760.png)

#### Ego

The advice we typically hear around EGO is, "Check your ego."

It is in your best interest to be a pleasant person to work with. There will be egos. Expect it. How you handle yourself will truly make or break your success at the studio.

Checking your ego only works when everyone else checks theirs as well - which typically does not happen. There will be situations where this happens and they\'re great, and there will be times where you will need to have the confidence to stand up for yourself as well.

![image](./images/unnamed_741.jpg)

#### Building your confidence level

Checking your ego and being humble doesn\'t mean putting down your work. In a safe work environment such as college, this may work, but in a professional environment you will be lowering people's expectations of your work.

Having confidence is part of the job. Your job as a designer is to deliver the best and most appropriate concepts on the characters you are given. You will face challenges every week, and you need to create solutions to design problems all the time.

Doing so requires having some level of confidence in your abilities. Failure can come from presenting half-baked ideas with your concepts because of a lack of confidence or defaulting to other people's opinions. Getting input is KEY to a successful design, and bringing your best to the table first shows that you are indeed giving your best.

You will get notes and notes and more notes, on most characters you take on. That doesn't mean you can switch off and rely on other people's opinions moving forward. Follow instructions, listen to feedback, read the descriptions, but ALSO follow your instincts, that's why they hired you in the first place.

#### Your Growth

The typical character designer's journey into the industry looks like this:

1. Apply to animation studios, complete and submit the tests they send to you.
2. Get hired and get your first design gig.
3. Struggle a bit getting up to speed once you get into your first production.
4. Spend lots of extra hours to catch up to the demands of the workload.
5. Start to crack the learning curve and make fast improvements.
6. Hit a stride and kick some butt.
7. Run into some inconsistency - some character designs you hit, some you miss.
8. Getting on a great show is really where you make progress. End up on a tough show - where you level off or stop making progress, then you're working really hard just to stay afloat.

It's a non-linear path. Why? Well for a number of reasons:

1. Talent - you need to build it. It takes time and practice.
2. Skill level - where you are at is indicative of the type of job you'll be ready for.
3. Experience - the more you have typically the more desirable you'll be.
4. Situation - relocation, work visas, family, getting a position on good shows and bad shows.

Expectations of what it's like in a studio:

1. We pick up certain things at college and then at jobs in smaller studios.
2. Working on a smaller project can be a greater opportunity for creative input.
3. When making the transition to a larger studio, realize it's a gradual process to learn everything you need to know.
4. In most cases you will be starting in a smaller role and building up to your vision of the ideal position you want to be in.
5. On a small production in a small studio you might have to do everything for the character designs; full turnarounds, colors, expressions, mouth charts, hand charts. In a big production, at a big studio, you might only be doing one aspect; maybe just clean-up, or finishing turns, since you'll be part of a team, where each member specializes in one or two areas, because there's a high volume of characters that need to get done every week.

In a perfect world every character designer would:

1. Work at their studio of choice.
2. Be on a project that they feel strongly about.
3. Make a meaningful creative contribution to the production.
4. Be part of a supportive crew that values their work and respects their opinion.

The reality of this job:

1. Every once in a while all of these elements will come together, in a positive way, and in your favor. However, it is rare to have them all fall into place at once even at the best of studios.
2. As pros we must find ways to do our best work and find creative satisfaction even while we're not working under optimal conditions.
3. As an entry level designer, and a lot of times as a mid-level designer, nearly all of these factors come down to breaks. Which means, for the most part, things that are out of our control.

![image](./images/unnamed_1225.png)

#### The Breaks

In this business sometimes you catch the breaks and sometimes you don't. Opportunities don't always line up with qualifications. Luck and timing definitely play a factor.

#### Breaks include

1. Getting Hired
   - Timing (lots of luck)
2. Which Project
   - There may be a show in the works that's right up your alley but your skills are needed on a different show
3. Your Leads
   - Different leads/supervisors have different styles
   - Some leads like to build up their teams
   - Some like to be very regimented in the process of the daily tasks and require constant communication about your progress
   - Others are more soft-spoken and keep communication to a minimum and just let the artists do their work

#### Other design roles

There are different jobs and positions for designers, some are more glamorous than others. Alternative roles include:

1. **Prop Designer:** Producing all objects, items and vehicles.
2. **Clean-up Artist:** Producing the final line, maintaining consistency and volumes while tracing the rough lines.
3. **Design Revisionist:** Revises character designs according to client notes or art director's notes.
4. **Design Assistant:** Also known as a Junior Designer, they do a bit of everything, finishing turnarounds, doing redresses on existing characters, creating head tilts, re-dressing re-use characters, creating hand charts and mouth charts on approved characters, prepping/labelling files to be exported so they can be shipped out and presented for review.

#### Best practices

1. The biggest complaint from designers is that they feel they are not being used to their full potential.
   - It's not always the production's goal to use you to your full potential. The goal is to get the series/film done at a consistent pace and at a high quality.
2. It's important to realize that the breaks are just that, and are, in most cases, out of your control.
   - You could end up spending energy worrying about this stuff to the point where it affects the work and your attitude.
3. The best practice is to make the most of the opportunities that present themselves.
   - When you get your first job there will be very little "training", most likely none at all, you'll be thrown into the work right away. You will have to dive in and learn what is required of you as you work through it.
4. Try not to take it too hard when you miss the breaks, because there will be other opportunities.
   - No one opportunity will make or break your career in animation/character design.

> **What determines being picked for character design on a production:**

1. Experience
2. Skill set
3. Personal style
4. Speed
5. Sensibility
6. Inventory/Availability
7. Momentum
8. Trust in you by the Art Director

What constitutes a 'good' character? Is it a Main Character or Primary Character? That might be a common consensus, since they'll have the most screen time, they'll need the most attention, they're the most important to the story, the most views will need to be illustrated, and the most additional assets made for it. However, some Supporting Characters often become more interesting and more fun to create; the sidekicks, the villains, the old wiseman, the quirky relative, the funny co-worker, the classroom friend, these usually become the more memorable characters in a film or series. When YOU think of your favorite character from an animated movie or series, it's very rare that it's the Lead Character.

![image](./images/unnamed_904.jpg)

What are your sensibilities or specialities? You'll discover these as time goes on, and your directors will notice what areas are your strengths and weaknesses. You may prefer to draw more mechanical/robot characters, it might be more cartoony funny-looking characters, it might be more realistic-looking human characters, or it might be animals and creatures. Your specialties and preferences will reveal themselves and will grow over time. You may end up on a production that has a style that you are very unfamiliar with, take the opportunity to research, practice and learn from it, you will only become a stronger artist as a result.

You may be offered a job that you can't accept because you haven't finished your current contract yet. Try not to worry about missed opportunities like this. First, see if you can work on BOTH, because if the overlap between both projects is manageable and you're willing to work overtime in order to wrap up on one production while starting on a new one, then it could work out good for everyone. This way you don't miss your chance on the other cool job. Also, you can talk to the Line producer or Director, to see if you can start a bit later and catch up with some over time later, this way, you don't miss that contract entirely, especially if it's a show you're looking forward to.

![image](./images/unnamed_1135.png)

If you see that there's another production in the studio that they're doing character designs for and you love the look and style of it, but you're stuck on the other less-appealing show, ask your supervisor/art director if you can possibly transfer over to the more desirable project. The more experience you have the more they will make changes to accommodate your preferences. Most times they cast and pick which designers go on which productions based upon their style, speed, and strengths. They can't always meet your requests, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

#### Speed

Each production is different for expectations on what rate of speed is required. Usually each character takes two weeks from concept to completion. But you are always working on several characters at once, some require more turn-around views than others, some require more angles and mouth charts and hand poses than others. It all depends on how comprehensive the design pack for each character is.

![image](./images/unnamed_028.gif)

> **Don't beat yourself up about not being a fast designer:**

Speed develops with time and the good news is that you're not going to be getting A+ characters at the studio on day one. They will give you simple characters in the beginning, or tasks that have you assisting a more senior designer. So you can learn the studio's pipeline, learn the etiquette in the reviews of your designs, and learn how to receive feedback, be mindful and resourceful when implementing the revisions to your work. Steady consistency in your performance and work quality and slow but gradual consistency in your rate of improvement will ALWAYS be noticed by your directors and supervisors.

![image](./images/unnamed_026.jpg)

#### Feedback

The feedback loop changes slightly from show to show. Once you've had a few years of experience and a few shows under your belt, you'll see there's a few patterns of workflow that work best, here are a few standards and bits of advice that would be good to know for most studios...

> **Understanding launches and review meetings:**

- Design Launch - every week or two, you'll have a meeting with the Art Director about your new design assignments, and what factors you need to consider and what references you need to use.
- Design Review - every week there's a meeting reviewing new and revised designs from the previous week, this is when your art director/design supervisor and possibly the showrunner, all offer feedback and creative direction. This could be in-person or through a live video conference call, and also as redlines/draw-overs with written notes in the form of emails and in online documents/spreadsheets.

> **Know what type of forum is it for the weekly reviews:**

- Are opinions being solicited?
- In most cases it is a presentation of work to the art directors & series director for their feedback.
- Sit back and observe the etiquette and be sure to respect it.
- Getting multiple sources of feedback is often disruptive for a character, but it's often unavoidable, there will be times where you get notes from a director and showrunner that might contradict each other, when this happens - see if there's a way to accommodate both notes with a compromise, or communicate with your supervisor/director (after the meetings) on what the best course of action is.

> **Different directors and supervisors have different expectations from designers:**

- Some will value your opinion, some won't.
- Some will have an open dialogue. Sometimes the dialogue is one-sided.
  - Try not to take it personally.
  - Stay humble.
  - Stay focused.
  - Remind yourself of what the goals are.
  - What is the intention behind the character personalities and their purpose in the story.

#### Addressing notes

- Get a feel for the director's sensibilities, try to get in their head.
- If you are just hitting the notes you're not doing enough.
- Avoid becoming simply a pair of hands.

> **Own your designs and your notes and get to the root of critiques and feedback:**

Getting back on the horse...

- You willhave your favorite characters changed or cut out.
- Don't let tough notes and story changes take the wind out of your sails.
- With tough notes try to take a step back and find the meaning behind the note. Approach the revision in a way that still keeps your contribution valid and creative.

#### Ebb and flow

- When you first start off in the industry, everything is precious.
- Big notes or character changes feel devastating.
- Working on a character design can be a rollercoaster.
- When our character design progress is doing well, we are doing well.
- You can be on top of the world one day while things are going well, and then be absolutely broken up the next when things start falling apart.

Over time you realize that the best approach is to have a slight emotional detachment from your work, and this attitude develops over time. Finding the combination of commitment to the production and dedication to the work is the secret recipe to live by. Stay a bit detached from the work so that you are not so devastated and crushed when designs get changed drastically, or given to someone else to do, or cut out of the production entirely. But not too detached if you don't care about the work, if you don't commit yourself fully to the production, it shows in your art and your creativity will suffer.

![image](./images/unnamed_035.gif)

#### Networking

1. **Politics are everywhere:**
   - In hiring, casting, advancement. It's a part of the game.
   - When politics work in your favor, they almost seem invisible.
   - When they work against you, it can be frustrating.
2. **The nature of politics:**
   - It's not all evil.
   - If you were to start a project, who would you hire?
   - Would you search long and far for the best candidate, or would you first start with people that you know and trust?
3. **People working politics:**
   - It's not unusual to see people schmoozing.
   - This again is one of the things outside of your control.
   - There will be people who find success this way.
   - There will also be folks who try to, and it backfires.
4. **Best practices:**
   - Sta'y true to your nature.
   - Let the schmoozers schmooze and focus on doing the best work you can.
   - Double down on your strengths, work on fixing your weaknesses a little bit at a time.
   - Your best network connections are your peers.
   - Remember this and remember to not burn bridges.
   - Thi's industry is very small.

![image](./images/unnamed_1238.jpg)

#### Experience

1. **Clarity over time:**
   - The experience you will gain in the first 8 weeks of your first job, will out-weigh all the stuff you learned in your courses.
   - As days and weeks go by, we realize that our perception of our own work has changed, you will look back on the stuff you did 2 months ago, and you'll see your mistakes and what aspects you do differently now.
   - There are so many things in this industry that seem confusing at the time but become crystal clear with more experience.
2. **Looking back on the work:**
   - You'll look back on times that you felt you were struggling and spinning your wheels and realize that you were growing in ways you didn't notice.
   - Other times you might think that you were shafted on a certain show by being given crappy characters to work on, only to look back and realize that your skill wasn't at the level to take on bigger tasks yet.
3. **The level is always going up across the industry:**
   - Keeping up is an effort in it of itself - You have to give yourself credit.
   - The demand for high quality work rises with each passing year in film work and series/streaming properties. You need to stay current and up to date on everything you can see that is being worked on; new releases, new shorts, new films, new shows, and realize you must always be working on how to improve.
4. **On growth in your environment:**
   - It's important to realize that everyone has their own path.
   - You'll see some of the slowest learners grow to be top talent.
   - At the same time you'll see top prospects burn out and leave the industry.
   - The longer you're around, the more you see the big picture. Worry less about the show to show.
   - Experience will enable you to know where to focus your energy in the right places.
   - The old saying 90% is just showing up. It may not be the case for us but may be more like 50%.

#### Review

1. There are things other than your work that will affect your career as a character designer.
1. The best bets for success are to stay true to your nature and focus your energy on your work.
1. Make the most out of the opportunities that are presented to you and try not to linger on the ones that never connected.
1. A career in character design is a marathon not a sprint. Work through it at your own pace.
1. You'll notice as your career moves onward - with each level of understanding comes more enjoyment.
1. If you want to be a successful designer, you must make yourself VALUABLE, and here's the bad news, you don't get to decide what 'valuable' looks like, the people you're trying to serve, do! And YOU must meet THEIR needs. That's it! So how do you make yourself valuable? Through practice, and lots of it! Up your skill points in draftsmanship and speed by diving into lots of different styles and techniques, master anatomy, sketch animals, monsters, robots, plants, cars, dabble in everything. That's the key to success - make certain you are always training yourself.

> You will learn that this industry is all about process. It\'s a funny thing because I was so desperate early on in my career. I remember thinking "like, man, I wish I could just take a pill that would just instantly make me better at this"\... And I ask students today, I say, "who here, if you could take a pill and you\'d just be a great designer and animator, who here would take it?" Of course, everybody would. But that thinking is really interesting to me because it just highlights this sort of backwards notion that it\'s results over process and results are inevitably shallow. And the more you work at your craft, the better the results become.
>
> Deliberate practice is what turns amateurs into professionals. Across every field, deliberate practice is what creates top performers and what they use to stay at the top of their game. As a general concept, 'practice' means preparing, and it's absolutely essential for expert performance. It's the act of repeatedly performing certain activities with the intention of improving a specific associated skill. We rehearse what to do in low-pressure situations so we'll be better when we use a skill in situations where something is actually at stake, such as in a competition or in the workplace with a fast-approaching deadline.
>
> In the beginning, you really want this high quality result, this professional result, and you don\'t know how to get it and you see other people doing it and you\'re like "ah, I don\'t know how they\'re doing that." And it\'s frustrating and it's this scary thing, because it\'s not like you're bummed about being bad at what you\'re trying to do. It\'s about not knowing what to do about that. And the answer is deceptively simple, which is... just do more. That\'s it, but it doesn\'t always feel like doing more is working. But it\'s the only answer, and the results of your hard work seem painstakingly slow and invisible.
>
> I would start to visualize because I was getting frustrated and distracted with emotion, all this kind of stuff and the pressure of getting better faster. And so I would visualize what my best work could be like, and it seems to live way out there, out of reach. There\'s no way to get at your best work fast and instantly.
>
> I visualized that as it existed and between it and me was just this long like, you know, tunnel of shit that I just had to dig through. And just move these bad sketches and designs out of the way. You work at a design, over and over to get the first ones, the bad ones out of the way, and eventually the superior design starts to emerge from the mess of roughs you make. And by doing that and going through that, what you realize is that the results start to, or the importance of the result, start to reveal themselves, and the progress is huge.
>
> The progress is small, the process is a burden, you know when you first start, you\'re digging for this result, and the process is just like you\'re enduring it and it\'s this burden or this task that you gotta fight your way through. And, you know, it gets so cumbersome, but working through a hundred bad drawings is what will get you to those few amazing ones. Like what pro photographers say, you need to take a hundred photos before you nail that one good one.
>
> Even just seeing the software, or the blank page looking back at you, it can be a major mental block to overcome, you get up in the morning and you sit down at your computer and you see that little Photoshop icon and you\'re like "ugh\-- don\'t even wanna click on it" - because everything about that thing makes me feel intimidated by the work that's ahead of me. It doesn\'t give me any positive feedback at all. It just keeps going like, "hey, you\'re terrible."
>
> At the end of the day, you MUST fall in love with the process. The discovery, the collaborating, the iterations, the many many versions you need to create, all to arrive at the final results, to explore and find the character for yourself. Within this process, is how you grow as an artist, build up those experience points and learn to be better at your craft.

### Contracts & Schedules

Here's the very boring aspect of the job. This can be a difficult subject to talk about, but here's some suggestions and thoughts on the topic of salaries and pay rates for when you get a character design job - this all depends on many different factors: Average hours of work, amount of designs being asked of you, deadlines and expected output speed, amount of revisions being asked of you to do, your personal level of experience, and how much is involved with each design (3-point Turnaround? Full 8-point Turnaround? Head Angles? Poses/Expressions/Mouth Charts? Quick Color Concepts or Full Color?)\... So there's many elements involved, which is why a good starting point is to settle on a daily rate for yourself, and compare that with the offer-of-pay or work contract being given to you.

The first thing for YOU to determine is to know if you will be exclusive to this client/employer. This means that regardless of whether you only do 3 characters per week with full turnarounds and no-color and two revision passes, or 5 characters per week with only two views and one revisions pass, you assume that you are full time, exclusive to this studio/director/client, and if you are consistent at putting in 8-9 hours per day (5 days per week) of work, and that is how much you are willing to dedicate to this production and to this client - then your fair rate of pay can be determined from that. Sometimes they need you only in a freelance (hourly) capacity, one week you'll perhaps be full-time, the next week only half time, and they require you to pass in a timesheet that logs your hours and you get paid accordingly. Or are you paid by the character (as they get completed or approved)? Or are you simply on salary expected to produce an average predetermined amount of characters every week. Ask these questions, or read your contract to determine what are your parameters and your expected output of work.

There might be an exclusivity clause in your contract, if so, realize that this means that if they catch you working for any other client/employer while under contract with them, they would have the right to terminate your employment. This is because exclusivity means you can only work for them while under their employment, this is a good thing, because it usually means they will pay you well, and want you to work full time and maybe even overtime for them and only them. If you find the pay is not fair (kinda low) given these terms, then you need to negotiate a higher salary or have them remove the exclusivity clause from your contract (their choice).

By working on multiple productions (very possible when working from home), you can be working on 2 or 3 or more projects at once, as long as they're all part-time jobs. Just be careful to not get too overwhelmed and overworked, and do not miss deadlines or compromise quality with your supervisors/directors.

All this stuff can be boring (or stressful) to think about, and tough to figure out with your employer. Don't worry about this too much, most of the time, your employer (the studio's line producer, operations manager, production manager) has it ALL written out for you, if there's lots of legal jargon you can't decipher from your contract, ask for a sit down or a screen-sharing video call to have them walk you through your contract, prior to signing and submitting it to them.

![image](./images/unnamed_547.png)

The daily rate system:

The client may want to pay a certain amount per hour or a certain amount per character, this is fine, from this info (and the rate they offer you) you can determine the daily rateyou're comfortable with, knowing you'll work full time, 8-9 hours per day, then you can easily determine what is fair and reasonable. Perhaps the client only has enough work for you to do 2 or 3 days per week? Then your daily rate still applies.

For example, if you set your daily rate to be \$200 per day \-- Then it doesn't matter how many characters per week, or how many revisions on your designs are requested. From this rate (or whatever rate you feel is fair) you can determine how much your income would be for a weekly rate or a per-character rate (on average), then you must determine (with your boss/client/director) how many characters you can develop per week.

> /// This is only an example, it's between you and your employer (and the production budget) what the adequate rate should be based on the work and the schedule ///

You know you're working 8 to 9 hours daily. This may translate into 5 characters in one week with 4-point turnarounds and a few head angles for each, or it may be only 2 characters because the client wanted to see several rounds of rough concepts and then had a few passes of notes on your turnaround views and color passes. Either way, your TIME coincides with your **rate of pay**.

![image](./images/unnamed_1253.jpg)

If the client wants to pay you \$800 per character and each character is a 5-point turnaround, clean line-art (no color), a few poses and expressions, with only two rounds of notes at the rough and rotation stages, at a rate of 4 characters every 2 weeks, and that is the agreed-upon consistency of work - then you must determine if this is do-able in the time constraints laid out. It may be a high rate of pay, but the work may not be do-able in the provided schedule. Often some testing is required, and the first one or two characters will determine how difficult the work will be. A two week trial period is not uncommon.

![image](./images/unnamed_492.jpg)

Once the style is established, are you able to do that amount of work to meet their weekly quota? If you are able to do this amount of work within the 40-45 hour time span to complete it, then you are meeting your personal **_daily rate_**, and your client is receiving the adequate amount of designs from you, so everyone is happy; the client gets the characters from you, and you are getting paid well for the work. You figure out: I will work 8-10 hours per day, I want to get paid \$240 per day regardless of how much work there is, multiply that rate by ten (10 days in a standard 2-week period), then that's your salary that you're aiming for, and your client expects to characters being completed every week, just an example!

If the client wants to pay you \$1400 per week, flat rate, with a yet-to-be-determined amount of work per week, then make certain the deadlines are realistic, since they can quickly overlap and build up, as we've seen in this document there can be many stages in the creative process simply in attempting to find the character's personality in the design along with locking down the style itself. This could have you spending weeks in the concept art phase, and then weeks to go through approvals for costumes, turn-around views, colors, and the many other technical aspects to complete the design sheets. Most times you don't KNOW how realistic the deadlines will be until you dive into it, and experience the workflow of a typical 2 week cycle.

![image](./images/unnamed_688.jpg)

**There are a few factors to consider:**

Is there an established character design style to follow?

If not, how many days or weeks of time is there for you (or someone) to do the necessary visual development ahead of time in order to ascertain the design style? If there's lots of steady feedback - how long will this feedback from the director/client take? Be aware (and make your boss aware) that the development side of the design could take several weeks, and could be treated as its own contract or its own project. Because when it comes to discovering the style, then this one first character could take SEVERAL WEEKS to complete, and only once this style is locked down then the creation of the other characters will go much much faster. Again, you expect a daily rate no matter what, they are paying for your time, if it's \$250/day, then you know you will commit a certain number of hours weekly to help get the production's character development style into view and made to their liking. How this gets quantified is up to them. The norm is to get paid every 2 weeks for the work performed during the time worked over the previous two weeks.

> [»][VlQFXMqAmu] These \$ numbers are not to be taken literally, every employer is different, every budget is different, and all studios are all different in their pay structures that are based upon your speed, experience and agreed-upon contract - so use these as a baseline example.

At first the nature of the work can present itself in a few different ways; It could mean exploring lots of different styles before even a single character is approved. But once the first one is approved, it sets up the template for all other characters to follow on the same visual path.

Character #1 could take 3 weeks to complete, as you'll be required to explore, rough out, and later refine the style for the main principle characters that will have the most time on-screen, but after that you can be creating a single-view character at a rate of 1 to 3 per day, so your output will accelerate considerably depending on how rough the sketches can be or how clean your submissions can be. Your personal speed translates into the amount of work output. The more efficient you are at producing a higher rate of characters per week, the more valuable an employee you will become to them.

Be aware that spending 2 hours on a rough character concept can be dragged out over several weeks. Because you wait on feedback, then redo that rough along with some alternate versions, then you do it again, then you refine it, then you make two more views, then there's some back-peddling, where the face and costume got looked at from another executive and they had some thoughts and opinions. So than previously-approved aspects of the character are now re-worked, this affects other elements of the character, and makes the refining and finalizing of a character to sometimes be a process that drags on for a long time.

![image](./images/unnamed_268.jpg)

You may be asked to fill out timesheets; these are logs that they will ask from you the hours you do weekly. You may only do 20 hours of actual work on a particular week if you were put on pause while approvals were waiting to come in and you didn't have other tasks to work on in the meantime.

You may be asked to fill out tax credit forms, these are very normal. TV/Film/Media tax incentives typically come in the form of Tax Credits, equal to a percentage of a production's qualified in- state/provincial spending and/or exemptions from sales tax on qualified transactions. Know that the production company relies on these forms to be signed so that they can receive a tax return on the portion of the budget they spend on artists' salaries (your salaries). The state/provincial and federal governments all pay for a significant portion of your salary (usually between 30-60% of your wages), signing those documents helps to make it all happen. Every city in every country has some sort of film/television/new media/gaming labor incentives program that the studio you work for must tap into, in order to complete the budget's production, this is the only way to get the deal from their client.

![image](./images/unnamed_1229.jpg)

If the style is already established, then it's up to you to start drawing/designing in that style as quickly as possible, which might mean your first few characters will take lots more rounds of revisions and notes before you can get on-track. Which might mean you'll need to put in more unpaid overtime in the first two weeks so that you can get your skills up to the standards required. There's nothing worse than falling behind schedule within just the first week or two of production, but don't worry, this is VERY common. Clients and directors will expect you to get accustomed to the style as soon as possible. This is a very normal expectation for the animation industry.

![image](./images/unnamed_584.png)

After the first week or two, you should be in a more solid groove and in a more consistent routine for your own personal workflow, you've practiced the style of the production a lot, and are getting the hang of it. As with ANY new production, the first couple weeks are the most difficult, as you might struggle to find your footing, and you will need to burn more hours of time in order to prevent falling too far behind, along with absorbing lots of notes and feedback on your designs.

Try to figure out what the parameters are and how to get into a workflow, from week to week it might vary a lot, for example:

- **Week 1**
  - 2 Main Characters \> Rough Concepts (6-10 sketches)
  - 2 Secondary Characters \> Rough Concepts (4-8 sketches)
- **Week 2**
  - 2 Main Characters \> Revisions - Refine select roughs
  - 2 Secondary Characters - Approved \> Produce Clean Line art and 4-point turnaround
- **Week 3**
  - 4 Character Redress \> Re-use Old Secondary Characters and place new costumes and new color scheme
  - 2 Main Characters - Approved \> Produce Clean Line art and 4-point turnaround
  - 2 Main Characters \> Produce Roughs for up and down head angles
- **Week 4**
  - 2 Secondary Characters - Line Art Approved \> Produce Color pass
  - 2 Main Characters \> Revisions - On the 4-point turnarounds
  - 2 Main Character Props \> Backpacks, Goggles, Walking Stick
  - 4 Character Redress \> Revisions
- **Week 5**
  - 4 Character Redress \> Revisions
  - 2 Main Characters Turnarounds - Approved \> Produce Color pass
  - 2 Secondary Characters \> Revisions on Color
  - 2 Main Character Props \> Revisions
  - 2 Main Characters \> Revisions on Head Angles - Revise and make line art version
- **Week 6**
  - 2 Main Characters \> Mouth Charts (3 views each, for happy+sad)
  - 2 Main Characters \> Rough Poses (6) and Expressions (6)
  - 2 Main Character Props \> Color pass
  - 4 Character Redress \> Color pass
  - 1 New Main Characters \> Rough Concepts
  - 2 New Secondary Characters \> Rough Concepts

See how every week's tasks tend to pile up when the previous week\'s assignments come back to you with notes and adjustments, and you'll notice there's lots of different stages to take care of. Normally color is done by a color designer or color stylist, and mouth charts, or additional costume changes and turnaround views are done by a secondary designer. But sometimes, if there's not that many characters to do each week, then YOU will have to do almost everything. As you can see, by the 6th week the tasks begin to overlap, there's at least 9 days of work compressed in a single week, as you await feedback on other assets. So be mindful of the hours you put in, keep track of the tasks you're given, **stay organized** with all the stages needed to be completed for each task for every design asset. Always triple check to make sure you re-read all the notes, making certain you cover everything that is required of you to change or implement in your work. This will help you to rack up those approvals.

![image](./images/unnamed_270.jpg)

The longer it takes for your client/director to come back with notes on a design you submitted, the higher the chances the overlapping tasks will accumulate. Simply take into account that there will always be some unforeseen circumstances and you don't have control over - like how long it takes for designs to be reviewed or approved. Sometimes it needs to go through several levels of approvals, filtering through many different people. After a design is complete it can take several days or several weeks before feedback returns to you, sometimes it can take just a few hours. It depends how many people need to see it, how readily accessible they are, how quick they are in providing comments and criticism, how fast they are with other aspects of the production, and how fast they are at reviewing and handing out notes.

![image](./images/unnamed_007.gif)

Schedules and deadlines are no doubt one of the least fun aspects of this work. But it's an unavoidable reality of the job.

**If the workload becomes too much to handle, there's a few ways for you to tackle the situation:**

- See if the over abundance of work will be temporary. For instance, only for this week everything has converged and coincidentally multiple deadlines have fallen on dates that merged in the same week, then you can push through this exception and do the extra time and effort to get the job done, as long as this is not a repeating pattern.
- Is the style of the designs more difficult and demanding than originally expected, or more laborious than initially agreed upon? Then you talk to your supervisor/director/production manager and see what can be done to alleviate the work, extend deadlines or have the volume of work and/or notes be reduced? Otherwise, deadlines will be missed. Request an assistant to help you in your tasks, or inform your supervisor of the delays, make a prediction as to the date of completion and make certain you meet that date. Keeping open communication with the person in charge of deadlines or the one assigning you the work is important.
- Unforeseen circumstances like you getting sick and needing a day or two toi recover, or the clients being unable to be decisive in their notes, or creative decisions have led to a pile up of designs having to be redone - all lead to disrupting the flow of work and forcing you to spend more time than predicted to complete the designs that were assigned to you. Communicate with your direct supervisor or director, inform them of your progress, your estimated time of completion, the reasons why you will need more time to finish the work, and discuss strategies on how you can get help, so that the work can continue to go through the pipeline without causing more delays.
- There might be ways for you to be more efficient in your work. Does the client trust you to bring the design task to the next stage without them seeing it again? If the designs you complete will include the revisions they gave you then ask them if you can push through to the next stage. Therefore reducing the number of passes, and making you consolidate more stages of approval to make things go faster with less submission & review time, which means less wait-time and less overlapping tasks for YOU. Example - The client has seen3 passes of your rough version, and on the last pass, they only had very minor tweaks to your art. Ask if you can do those small adjustments AND proceed to doing the turnaround views in order to prevent re-submitting the same design again, costing you and them more time to review and offer feedback. Some clients/directors do not allow any stage to move forward without 100% approvals declared in the previous step, otherwise are very open to it for the sake of efficiency, but usually trust has to be built up first between you and them.

![image](./images/unnamed_021.gif)

These tactics can help to prevent you from being overwhelmed with too many assets to complete at one time. Or perhaps MORE stages of review are needed in order to prevent unnecessary work from being done. If you produce lots of clean, polished artwork only for it to be torn apart and rebuilt from scratch, then maybe to have a few rough stages as concept passes in the beginning would work better to prevent unnecessary revisions.

This way you're not wasting time making too much clean line art, only to have it re-done, and works best for more hands-on directors and creative producers that are artists themselves. Doing quick rough thumbnails with lots of options and variations for them to choose from will have them see and understand your intentions more clearly, and depending on the director, they may love to do draw-overs / redline sketches, to help visualize their revisions for you.

![image](./images/unnamed_353.png)

This route works best when certain clients tend to approve a design at the rough stage but then change their minds at the next clean/color stages. Sometimes you don't see a problem with the design until you attempt various turn-around views, you can spot problematic areas that force you to revise yourself to make the rotations work. So it's faster to do these rough concepts, it will minimize the revisions later as you gradually refine the process and hone in on the approved look. This way creates more submissions and more review stages, but each stage is quicker and faster to do, and makes things slow at the start with lots of changes as you are searching for the proper design, but the changes are easier to do and notes coming back to you in later stages become less and less.

Also be prepared for the times when work will pile up and will seem overwhelming, just know that the wave will pass, and will not happen too often.

Every project is different, when you are getting overwhelmed talk to your supervisor/boss/client, about how to relieve the pressure or to push back deadline dates.

![image](./images/unnamed_1238.jpg)

In terms of your weekly salary or hourly rate, you rarely have room to negotiate. Budgets are locked in and are out of your control, and in most cases out of your boss's control too. All the strategies outlined above are for you to use in various situations. Later on in your career, once you have lots of experience under your belt, there's a better chance to arrange and haggle on your salary as your skill set and experience will make you of higher value (as an artist) to their production and the studio at large. In the first few years of your career as a character designer you are still learning the ways of the production pipeline and what works best for your own workflow. As you gain speed, efficiency and knowledge, you will rise in value, and studios will begin to seek YOU out. Then you will have more room to negotiate your work loads and salaries.

Deadlines and schedules can be the least fun aspect of this job. But for YOUR own sanity, staying organized with your own workflow is vital to staying efficient and stress-free.

Remember: You can base the combinations of labor vs time vs income by starting with the **daily rate** system, and work your way up or down from there. How much do you value a full day of work to be for your skills? How much is a full-day-of-work for you? Assess the difficulty and demands of the production, adjust your rate accordingly and then compare with their contract offer. As you grow older and increase those skill points, that rate gradually increases. As months and years build up, so will your experience and speed, and so will your value to any employer.

### Commissions

While waiting on feedback from the animation studios on your applications or design test submissions, or just during your free time between work contracts, many artists do online freelance work through commissions. There's lots of advice for freelancers out there for how commissions work, from one-time gigs, to full-time regular client work, to online character illustration requests, including portraits and caricatures. Commissions are far more informal and very casual, a simple agreement between you and a client.

![image](./images/unnamed_1331.png)

For one-on-one commission work like this, where you do a single illustration for an individual, there's no need for signing contracts. Remember, you don't hand off your work until you get paid.

There's varying opinions on how artists should handle commission work, see [here][hezSbBUfax] and [here][pCAEKoVEUg] for just a few of the many guides you can find on the subject. With this advice in mind you'll have all the info you need to dive into this realm, you will learn through repetition and as time goes on you will figure out what methods and what system works best for you. Here's some additional tips on self-promotion: [How to Market Yourself on Social Media][KVvanjHoAX]

![image](./images/unnamed_659.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_652.png)

### Freelancing

Here are some contracts for more professional works on bigger, long-term projects to consider using between you and your clients:

[Professional Artist / Client Toolkit][wBgnMnDDXY]

These are pre-made contracts and agreements where you really only have to fill in the blanks with your name, date and signatures for whatever occasions, be it cease and desist / original artwork / commission work / all rights for limited time purposes. Read these contract templates and arm yourself with them, and be sure to use the appropriate ones. These are for you to use as an independent artist, for medium to large sized projects between you and another individual, purely for freelance work. Not to be used for character design studio tests from animation/game companies and production studios, they will provide you with their own contracts since they hire you as a contract worker or employee for the services they want you to do for them.

- There's varied opinions on how to break into freelancing (in the fields of design / illustration / animation), here's a few tips:

Article by _Mark Mayerson_:

> If you are not on salary or working under a contract and somebody asks you to produce some art or character designs, here are the things you need to know (in writing) before you start work.
>
> - How much will you be paid and what is the payment schedule?
> - Are there royalties or other compensation you are entitled to in the future?
> - What are the specifics of the work you are providing?
> - What format are you delivering the work in?
> - When is the work due?

>
> If the client provides this information in a written document, you have the right to ask for changes to anything that is specified. The client has the right to say no, but so do you. An agreement implies that both parties (the client and the artist) see eye to eye on conditions under which the work will be produced.
>
> You also have the right to consult a lawyer, agent or other professional on the agreement before signing it.
>
> There is a tendency for artists to be so thrilled that somebody wants their work that they skip all of the above or worse, they agree to work on spec. Spec work, (work done on speculation), means that the artist produces work for a client with no promise of payment. There are also cases where a client promises no money but offers the benefit of experience or exposure.
>
> There is a word that describes working for free: Slavery.
>
> Slavery can only occur through force, which we have not yet sunk to in North America, or complicity, where the artist agrees to be a slave.
>
> There are occasions where artists may choose to work for free. Work gets donated to a charity or done to help a friend or family member. But if a profit making company is asking for artwork, they should pay for it and all of the above conditions should be met.
>
> Please note that the above is different from pitching. In that case, you are creating the artwork for yourself and hope to interest a buyer in it. If no payment is forthcoming, you are free to take that artwork elsewhere to try to market it. Doing free work for yourself is different from doing free work at the request of a profit-making company.
>
> I\'m going to talk about two instances that I\'ve been consulted on in the past. I have to be vague so as not to break any confidence.
>
> In the first case, a distributor was interested in a student film made by a Sheridan graduate. The distributor wanted non-exclusive theatrical rights and exclusive rights for DVD, VOD, TV, Internet and Merchandising. In exchange for these rights, the distributor was willing to pay \$50. I told the grad that for the low fee, none of the rights should be exclusive. If the grad had the opportunity to sell the film again in any market, he should be able to do it. The student asked for changes to the contract and the rights were made non-exclusive.
>
> In the second case, a college grad from an animation program was commissioned by a company to produce a short film for a fee. When the film was delivered, the grad was told that the person who commissioned the film didn\'t have authorization to do it. The company was sorry and felt bad about it, but could only offer the grad half the agreed upon fee as a gesture of good will. The grad asked me for advice. I warned the grad that if she made a fuss, there was a chance that the company would refuse all payment. The grad wanted to proceed anyway, so I counseled the grad to tell them that she had an email from a company employee and she looked upon that as a contract. If there was a problem, it was between the company and the employee, not the company and her. If they didn\'t pay her in full, she would publicize the fact that the company had ripped her off and would warn other artists not to do work for the company. Furthermore, if the company didn\'t pay the full fee and used the work, she would sue the company for copyright infringement.
>
> The company responded that they regretted her aggressive tone. This is known as blaming the victim. However, they did agree to pay the full fee.
>
> There is no shortage of companies looking to take advantage of young artists. It is important to understand the proper way to do business, demanding a signed, written agreement that covers the payment, the rights, the deadline, and the deliverables, before the artwork is created. Your art and your time are what you are selling as a professional. If you work for free or don\'t proceed in a professional manner, you are merely a hobbyist and you are hurting people who are professionals in this industry.

### Staying Productive

Your journey in learning has only begun! Here are a few strategies that can really help boost your creativity and productivity:

#### 1. Have a Designated Creative Space

Because of the way our brains are wired, it can be much easier to get creative if your brain associates a specific location with your artistic practice. So, allocate a nice, comfortable space for yourself. Whether it\'s a desk, couch, bed, or even somewhere outdoors that you enjoy. The most important thing about whatever creative space you pick is that it should be cozy and functional. Remember to make sure your tools are also easily accessible in or nearby this space!

Have a portable creative space (and tools) also, like [this sketchbook kit][jUPlurMkul].

How to start your sketchbook [guide][JhNfntGwTK].

The fundamentals are truly all you need... but you need to know them and know them very well, [practice drawing this][epDDwIYHhL].

![image](./images/unnamed_1370.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1022.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_216.jpg)

#### 2. Start a Multi-Part Project

A great way to motivate yourself to get creative immediately is to set yourself a project that requires multiple different pieces. Maybe it\'s a small comic (do one panel per day), a series of character studies, or even just participating in a month-long art challenge; there's many to choose from only like Inktober, the 100DayProject, or other themed challenges like drawing a specific object daily, or exploring different art styles, or a series a small digital paintings. There's dozens of options like these to try out amongst online communities. Follow your intuition: [Becoming a Better Artist][fSwWrbsXJn]

By providing yourself with an ongoing project you are going to add structure and stability to your creativity and ensure that you are practicing and developing your skills more consistently. This could just be very simple low-intensity self-improvement schedule, like this: [Artist Starter Plan][PzRgIOqpur]

![image](./images/unnamed_466.jpg)

#### 3. Create a List

When you are experiencing art block it can be great to have a list of ideas that inspire you. So, next time you are feeling super motivated and full of awesome ideas, note them down on your phone or in your [sketchbook][pFgRahOIui]. That way, when you are struggling to come up with new ideas, you will always have a list to refer back to!

Dedicate weekly time to studying: [Practice Drawing Forms][LcShOerSmy]

Research and use the tips that other artists with experience have to offer:

- [Tip 1][SyBgiUxOMd]
- [Tip 2][izKwCABtQX]

#### 4. Take Breaks

When working full time: Every hour, take a 5 minute break. It's important to get up, stretch, look out the window to get your eyes adjusted to focusing on distant objects again, hydrate, or get some coffee/snacks in you, but doing this refreshes your brain too, it's a mini-reset, before getting back down to focusing on the work.

Sometimes you get in a state of hyper-concertration, time flies by. You're in a flow state, also known as \"being in the zone,\" a mental state of complete immersion and energized focus in an activity, leading to deep enjoyment and effortless action. Only when you naturally break away from that, THEN take a break. There's nothing wrong with prolonged states of productivity.

#### 5. Fifteen Minutes a Day

15 minutes a day seems pretty easy, right? By setting yourself an achievable amount of practice time you are much more likely to be consistent. You aren't always going to have infinite time each day to practice, and setting larger time goals can make creativity feel like a daunting chore! So, aim for just 15 minutes a day, some days you might even start and then decide you feel like creating for hours instead! Either way, you will be achieving your goal. During these 15 minutes, focus on drawing/painting a new style, or learning a new piece of software, or just watching a tutorial for a new software or technique.

These are just a few of hundreds of subjects you can search up to collect as reference, and use to practice drawing with.

#### 6. Carry Your Own Sketchbook

Every professional artist has a sketchbook and knows how to use it. This is a big part of being an artist as you can go out into the real world and draw real stuff.

> 👉 [Drawing Exercises for Warm-up][LcqoVTXpoC]

![image](./images/unnamed_1596.png)

You can find [helpful guides][pSXaiKNWri] that teach you the basics of [drawing][CfcXjLTiJz] in a sketchbook. But it's ultimately just a way to loosen up and draw away from the computer. This is especially useful for concept artists who plan to work digitally, but character designers need to practice in their sketchbooks too!

The [Moleskine sketchbooks][xoGsUVrWKx] tend to be the most popular and they're super easy to carry with you. All you need is any drawing utensil (pencil or pen) and some free time. The sketchbooks are lightweight and easy to handle in any climate, and search around there's plenty of [less expensive][cTuKesLDTI] alternatives.

![image](./images/unnamed_786.png)

Look into this guide on [choosing the best sketchbook][GrtigiCzFS] to find one that works for your needs and goals.

Whenever you're on a trip that might break your typical routine, the sketchbook can keep you on task. Even 15 mins of daily drawing & doodling is better than nothing. You just want to keep yourself in that mindset of putting pencil to paper every **single day**.

Treat this little [sketchbook][TiYcKUHnwu] as your personal scrapbook for new ideas, or to test out ideas, doodles and designs and characters and creatures and plants of all sorts. Be willing to try stuff and don't feel like anything in your sketchbook is finished work. You never have to show anybody your drawings, because they're really only for you to practice freely without limitations or judgment: [Sketchbook Inspiration][jAdEiViLQj]

Another exercise to do: Fill a sketchbook in 30 days, as story artist Matt Jones once did [here][FCMZiIsitf].

![image](./images/unnamed_023.png)

And check out his techniques in his fast-and-loose gesture drawing videos [here][UEnZnSEgrI].

Check out [this post][LXGddRGUir] talking about how to train yourself for steady drawing improvements. If you don't have a full-time job: There's a recommended schedule of drawing 5 hours per day: 2 in the morning, 1 after lunch and 2 in the evening.

Not everyone will have time for this but it gives you a solid model to attempt, and be careful to never [compare yourself][MMOgbXuHvD] to other artists. Instead, learn from other designers, discover new illustrators and do [style studies][qsOjGZceJz] of their work.

When you are not working at a job, it's important to keep upgrading and improving your skill levels. Whether it's perspective, anatomy, clothing, plants, buildings, animals, or anything and [everything][PYCDuLsGzH], find the aspects you're weakest at, and focus on ways to improve upon them: [Sketching tips to help elevate your skills][YQJgGrhuOy].

> Look into this guide on the best [digital tablets][sAJSocGpSU].

When you have all day free to work on your craft and practice your art - Drawing for 5 hours is much better than 1 or 2, and you'll see [improvements][vkmHrPQOyU] quicker which will then positively impact your confidence too. Even if you can do it 10-20 minutes per day, even if it's entirely digital sketching too, every little bit helps. Stay focused, keep practicing, try to keep yourself motivated.

Sketchbook doodles by Laura Horobin

> "When you doodle in your sketchbook, do so knowing that you should NEVER show your sketchbook contents to ANYONE, not EVER\... Why? Because if you can keep telling yourself to never show your sketches from your books to anyone, it will FREE you to grow faster as a character artist! It will free you to draw in it more, free you to stay rough and loose, free you to try out different things, and without the burden of wondering 'what will people think?' You are not creating sketches to eventually show to someone, this is purely for your own growth and benefit. The freedom of knowing this, knowing that your sketches aren\'t for anyone to see, will allow you to draw in it more. Permitting you to stay fast and rough and to draw anything and to draw in the book more without the fear of being judged or critiqued. THIS will make your skills evolve faster, knowing that it's ONLY for practice, and this way you'll fill up sketchbooks quicker, and doing this will accelerate your artistic improvements." -Portion from a Character Design Workshop by Ron Doucet

#### 7. Just Get Started

Let's call it _\'using inertia\'_. It's a million times easier to keep doing something once you have started. So if I don't feel like working out I tell myself I'll just do a short work out. Or if the dishes need to be done I'll tell myself to do one. More often than not, once I start doing something my brain stops fighting so much against it. It's a psychological trick you play on yourself to get motivated.

The important thing though is to let yourself only do the short workout or that one dish if you start and still are fighting yourself. Otherwise you just don't start in the first place because you know you are really talking about doing the whole thing.

![image](./images/unnamed_509.jpg)

Usually, it\'s the initial push, the start of something, anything, which is the most challenging or difficult. But once we start what we want to do and build up momentum, continuing that task is easier. Also known as the \'Theory of Momentum\'. The same can be said about going from one task to another. If you go to work, then immediately go to the gym, cook dinner, put away laundry, without taking a rest between each task, accomplishing each becomes easier, the break and rest you take later will feel much more satisfying. This momentum helps you to flow from one task to the next without having to expend that initial starting energy for each individual task. [Sketchbook drawing][FCjOtbRQQk] and character design should be approached the same way.

> "The best way to draw in your sketchbook? The messier the better, just let it all out. Doodles, scribbles, notes, sketches, unfinished drawings \... everything. Trying to keep your sketchbooks neat and tidy with only \"nice\" drawings can actually end up holding you back from making the leaps of progress that truly-free experimentation allows. That\'s not to say your sketchbook can\'t be neat, or tidy, or have beautiful drawings, but if you make those things your exclusive goal, you may be missing out on a big part of what a sketchbook can do for you and your art. At its best a sketchbook is not your best-ofs." - Lorenzo Etherington

Beginners rarely know where to start. This is why it's so difficult to jump right into drawing because there's so much to learn and there's no specific direction to go.

To handle this, just organize a small lesson plan that fits into the time you have. If you're only drawing for 1 hour each day then you might do a breakdown of 20 minutes of gesture drawing, 20 minutes of shape drawing, and 20 minutes of geometric/perspective drawing.

![image](./images/unnamed_1560.png)

When first getting started you need to put the most effort into your fundamentals. It's fine to make time for fun drawing. But this isn't real focused practice and won't yield the quickest rate of growth. Practice techniques to strengthen your skills:

#### 8. Don't Stop Learning

Even when you are not working, there's always something you can do to prepare yourself, and better yourself, for when the work starts up again! You'll never stop learning, throughout your entire career as an artist. Art and design is a life-long journey of a non-stop habit of exploration and discovery. Where practice will never make perfect, it will only lead to more practice. Be inspired by other people's journeys:

- [Advice for Starting your Art Journey][ivSsxAAUYP]
- [Pro Artists' Secrets to Their Success][UODNrAsuiM]
- [Art is Hard by][CcSrRdoxMm] [Mattias Pilhede][rNWrrJbcgK]
- [Drawing Advice by Campbell Walker][RgNMAqVYUA]
- [Jason Wang's Drawing Fundamentals][LfnQhaxtIH]
- [Lucas Peinador\'s Tips for Artist Survival][fHPeveXbsf]
- [Kyle Webster's Illustration Masterclass][bOBWWsfCMm]
- [A Conversation on Character Design with Shiyoon Kim and Jin Kim][lPoIfPVTSi]

![image](./images/unnamed_667.jpg)

Learn all the rules and basic theories, learn them well, only then, can you know how to break them properly!

Collect and absorb all the knowledge from all the books available online like:

- 👉 [Fundamentals of Character Design][akazROefsc]
- 👉 [The Character Designer][eDlUxKaOmh]

![image](./images/unnamed_436.png)

Every artist/teacher/author has their own style and ways of showing illustration techniques, sometimes you'll even notice some will contradict the advice of others (and that's OK, try everything and see what works best for YOU), many of these books and videos cover the same aspects that were mentioned in this document. But there is always a lot to gain through this repetition of methods and thought process. Read all these books and watch all these tutorials, learn and hold on to as much as you can, on some occasions you may see some information that contradicts other things, but this is all for you to filter in and absorb the things that make most sense to you and your sensibilities.

Learn from the old masters like [Kim Jung Gi][KybdyUUtfq] and [Frank Frazetta][OUOsRqQMFD].

Different artists and teachers all have their own unique experiences and points-of-view. One may say to do something one way, while the other proclaims another way. Ultimately YOU must pick and choose what you want to learn from and adopt and absorb for your own self. Try out various techniques and the ones that work best for you, will be the lessons and methods you hold on to, and put into practice.

The dedication and commitment needed to do the job is like any other discipline - painters, sculptors, writers, musicians, chefs, visual artists, we have to immerse ourselves in the material, know it well, then dive into the work, as actor Walter Goggins explains [here][squyfjYeBm].

![image](./images/unnamed_237.png)

Consider expanding your knowledge by studying from other online programs, here are just a few of many options:

- The [Learning Character Development and Design][lnVpzkMQab] course
- The [Schoolism Expressive Character Design][VfvCaGAzYe] course
- The [Aaron Blaise Creature Design][nbfzQVdgBE] course
- Evan Cheng's [Character Design Course][DPezBRvSjs]
- Jesse LeDoux's [Building Your Character][pvHfKFRGiB] course
- Brookes Eggleston's [Learn Character Design][BRbyHLLKhR] course
- Tony Bancroft's [Drawing Character Poses with Personality][FmQkRjGVpo] course
- The [Silver Drawing Academy][SMxaLWybdG]
- Jean Fraisse's [Designing Characters for Animation and Video Games][RAAYVOpKuA]
- Magdalina Dianova's [Drawing Appealing Characters with Personality][KKuJNyzYTQ]
- Mitch Leeuwe's [Drawing Fundamentals Tutorials][yTsFLNFFxB]

Most of these are relatively inexpensive, if you're considering any of these - research any reviews on these first, watch previews and teasers and samples of the tutorials & classes. This will give you a hint if it's something you'll like and benefit from.

#### 9. Practice Practice Practice

If you find you are quite self-motivated and in no need of taking any of these online courses, then everything in this document, and its provided links along with lots of practice is truly all you need. Search for and discover any online trends you could participate in. For example; [this exercise][eRsqRrpqZa] where you pick a movie celebrity or pop culture character and draw them in various styles.

There are many ideas you can find online for practice exercises to do, here's just a few:

![image](./images/unnamed_043.jpg)

Practice merging styles together into cartoon mash-ups, like how Dirk Schulz re-skinned some classic characters by drawing American Dad & Family Guy in the style of Tom & Jerry:

![image](./images/unnamed_1534.png)

Savannah Alexandra drawing Pokémon in the style of Chuck Jones:

![image](./images/unnamed_1692.png)

Bob's Burgers re-designed in the style of Archer:

![image](./images/unnamed_1303.png)

Another fun exercise is to find a few different styles, and work on ways to combine them into one or cross-pollinate them, to achieve a [blend of styles][xyFYyNTQnA] as a way to experiment and learn how they work:

![image](./images/unnamed_1431.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_153.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1239.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_719.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1073.jpg)

An experiment to explore is to draw the same one character in various styles, could be a self portrait or any new creation of your choice:

Another alternative is to pick a well known animated character and re-designing them to match some other well-known styles:

![image](./images/unnamed_1063.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_360.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_319.jpg)

Create some tasks and artistic experiments for yourself. See how master cartoonist [Mike Holmes][rIklmYDAZl] pursued a [personal project][bIRFQMESzx] to flex his illustration muscles by producing a drawing of himself (and his cat) in a new style each week. He chose certain properties, illustrators, and comic artists as his inspiration, and created a great collection of self portraits. He learned a lot about himself, and it made him explore & discover new drawing habits, which quickly expanded his skill sets in the process.

![image](./images/unnamed_259.jpg)

Another fun exercise is to redesign old timey comic book characters into a more cartoony or modern style:

![image](./images/unnamed_054.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_609.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_979.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1365.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1468.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_859.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_630.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_167.jpg)

Art director Connie Kang created a great exercise for herself here, in her post with this artwork, she wrote:

Excited to share a new series of animal-to-human character designs I've been working on! Each piece reimagines an animal as a unique human personality --- blending nature, fashion, and storytelling. It's a fun exploration of body language, attitude, and identity through the lens of character design.

![image](./images/unnamed_045.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_376.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1137.jpg)

![image](./images/unnamed_370.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1463.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_118.jpg)

Creating a series of illustrations like this can really get you to think about creatively depicting story, attitude, personalities and atmosphere within your characters.

Find exercises to try out, have fun with them, and fill up your paper sketchbooks (or digital sketchbooks) - for example, you can try this... cram as many different characters as you can on one page:

![image](./images/unnamed_1279.png)

![image](./images/unnamed_1727.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1634.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_585.png)

#### 10. Organize Your Self-Improvement Lessons

You should start by setting aside time to draw every day on focused tasks. This might be 15-30 minutes or it might be 4 hours (or even more, depending on the time you choose to commit to this). The point is to stick with this time [every single day][qeOHvlEcnJ] to never avoid drawing.

You can also focus on specific aspects of anatomy; narrowing down particular body parts and research and immerse yourself in these areas to learn all about them.

![image](./images/unnamed_1074.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1659.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_733.png)

Dive into more complex areas for yourself. Discover styles you may not be familiar with, like detailed giant monster designs:

- 👉 Watch [this video][XRaIYtYpUM] by Scott Flanders on his drawing process.
- 👉 Watch [these videos][mTuiFRGKdy] by Bobby Rebholz on his drawing process.

Practicing the drawing of animals, insects and creatures are often overlooked. There's many more guides, tutorials & techniques to explore for designing animals & creatures, here's just a few:

- 👉 [The Art of Animal Drawing by Ken Hultgren][nTBxeKBrCk]
- 👉 [Animal Character Design Inspiration - Part 1][VNeLwciUQY]
- 👉 [Animal Character Design Inspiration - Part 2][DhqOdYpkKF]
- 👉 [Creature Design Tips - Part 1][jXxJyJYolA]
- 👉 [Creature Design Tips - Part 2][fUlCPhTTht]
- 👉 [Dina Norlund's Process for Designing a New Creature][oGbLVaaAfT]

Working on and presenting non-human characters will add diversity to your artwork and portfolio.

![image](./images/unnamed_444.jpg)

These are just examples.

Practice through repetition, find and discover new techniques, find various things to focus on, and draw iterations and versions of the same subject over and over, just like practicing piano, only through repetition can you learn the piece well. Practice drawing that subject in various angles and styles, over and over and over again. Explore and experiment different methods to broaden your skill sets throughout the design spectrum. Think about what areas of drawing you are weakest at or most fearful of doing, and research these areas and make yourself sketch them over and over.

The point of working with a self-made, rigid schedule is that it keeps you honest. Every day you'll be working towards building a subconscious routine that just sorta happens whether you're thinking about it or not.

You might have some days where you can't make the time to practice because of an unforeseen circumstance or just being too tired. If that's the case just move your drawings to the next day. Or tack on extra time throughout the week to make up for lost drawing hours.

![image](./images/unnamed_971.png)

> Using pantone markers and highlighters can also be fun to add contrast and tonal values!

![image](./images/unnamed_626.png)

It really doesn't matter what you're drawing in the beginning. If you never had much practice [drawing as a child][gCkcEaixpd] or doodling in your school scribblers and such, that's totally fine, most likely you need to catch up for that lost time, and do lots of line mileage now, to get your skill levels up! Don't be nervous about the long road ahead - start now, be consistent, draw every day, look up lots of references, re-read this document, watch the videos, [listen to the advice][qzKuKKnrGD], and you'll advance quickly. There's many, many different areas here to challenge yourself with, don't be overwhelmed, tackle one thing at a time, write down your battle plan for what areas to practice first, make lists, and get started right away.

![image](./images/unnamed_1238.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_457.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_330.png)

The benefit of being a newbie is that you can draw pretty much anything and improve. If you drew lines for 30 minutes a day you'd see your [line work][EHpNlEVdtl] improve in no time. But at some point you will need to actually start focusing your drawing efforts and trying to practice certain skills. Narrow down specific areas that interest you and any areas you are weak in.

![image](./images/unnamed_1297.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1160.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_226.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1275.png)

Make yourself a lesson plan that moves between different topics. Practice perspective for a few days, and then move on to anatomy, then perhaps birds, switch to plants and trees, then maybe insects, then furni, and then hairstyles. Switch between different subjects so that you give yourself a well rounded [art education][UjWzZebkMv].

![image](./images/unnamed_658.png)

For inspiration - observe, search through, save, and study online threads, reels, boards and forums like these [character design studies][lMnQFKmlKM], along with many other [online visual libraries][xhFkVLyNgX], and purchase [good books][OcZkOFxUIG]!

It cannot be stressed enough: the importance of getting on a schedule. It is possible to just draw whenever you have free time. But that sort of loosey-goosey scheduling isn't how you build consistent month-over-month progress. Remain regimented, continuous, steady - with a list of topics, subjects and items to mark off to practice on.

![image](./images/unnamed_1359.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_1612.png)
![image](./images/unnamed.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_731.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_665.png)
![image](./images/unnamed_233.png)

If you stick with it and get into the habit of drawing every single day, then you're guaranteed to see improvements. Self-motivation and perseverance will help you get through the early stages. Learning art has little to do with inspiration and everything to do with hard work. Just like working out your muscles, consistency is the key, always!

> "It's not about the journey, it's not about the destination, it's about the person you become on the journey." - Jimmy Carr

An Article by _Clara Lieu_, Visual Arts Professor at the _Rhode Island School of Design_:

Drawing is a highly complex beast which involves so many different elements at various skill levels. Rather than get into all of those details, I\'m going to boil it down to four fundamental directives that will help improve your drawing abilities across all skill levels and media.

1. Draw from direct observation\
   - This sounds so simple, and yet I\'m appalled at how many artists don\'t work from direct observation when they are looking to improve their drawing skills. Photographs may be convenient and easier to work from, but they\'re a cheap shortcut that will lead to the development of all sorts of bad habits. The amount of information that a photograph has pales in comparison to seeing a subject in real life. This is not to say that one should never ever in their lifetime work from a photograph; I work from photographs all the time now.
   - However, I\'m able to do this because I\'ve developed skills based on many, many years of working from direct observation.
   - When you work from life, you experience your subject matter in a way that a photograph could never allow you to: you can touch your subject, smell it, walk around it, and see the subject within the context of its environment. This overall sensory experience is vital towards your understanding of your subject matter and will translate into your drawing.
   - Drawing is as much about learning how to see as it is about the marks that you put on the page. Experiencing your subject in real life will teach you how to hone your skills in observation. The skills that you will gain from working from direct observation will tremendously inform and support your ability to work from all sorts of other references.
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_1307.png)
2. Practice daily\
   - Drawing is very similar to athletics. If you were an athlete, you would have a rigid schedule of training set up that you would adhere to. Drawing is the same way: it requires serious focus, rigorous training, and intense physical stamina. Every time you sit down to draw, it\'s an opportunity to sharpen your eye, and become more proficient in coordinating your mind and eye with the physical movements of your arm and hand. Many people get impatient with drawing and expect results right away. You have to be committed, and be able to recognize that improvement is a slow and gradual process. One would never expect to be an Olympic-level skier after one week of training, the same way you can\'t expect to be a master of drawing after working for a few days.
3. Look at historical drawings
   - Go to the library and check out books (or go [online][MOVpMwDBjo]) that feature drawings by historical artists. The drawings that you\'ll learn the most from are gesture drawings and quick sketches done in sketchbooks. In these quick sketches you\'ll get to see all of the visual evidence: you get to see all of the mistakes, all of the troubleshooting that happens in an artist\'s drawing process. This is what is so unique about drawing that you won\'t see in other media like painting and sculpture \-- the opportunity to see traces of an artist\'s process in a drawing. Investigate and analyze what kinds of strategies these artists take in their drawing process and try to use them in your own.
4. Practice gesture drawing\
   - If you can do strong gesture drawings, you\'ve already won half the battle. Gesture drawings are the core of any drawing, they capture the essence of what a drawing is trying to say in just a few strokes, in just a few minutes. The first two minutes of a drawing are critical in that they lay the foundation for the rest of the drawing. It doesn\'t matter how polished your drawing is if the initial gesture isn\'t there to begin with.
   - ![image](./images/unnamed_267.png)
   - By Maaike Scherff
   - Ideally, one should practice gesture drawing from a nude model, but if you don\'t have access to a model, there are plenty of other options. You can go to a local cafe and sketch people sitting in the cafe, or draw a bunch of friends who are hanging out. One of my friends always liked going to the beach to draw because people sit still, and they\'re practically naked anyway. I had a peer in art school who used to go to college parties and draw all of the drunk people sitting around. Get creative and find as many contexts as possible where you can practice your gesture drawing.
   - There's many free online Figure Drawing classes and resources to choose from (warning - nudity):
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 1][HVKbbAzNfM]
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 2][rgdRzoZgwC]
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 3][UjYQZHeqql]
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 4][RqMUhkuXDp]
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 5][jmLrZIUrnz]
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 6][GNyDaqbeWz]
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 7][XsEjFdbEkC]
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 8][LlgdpqtLrE]
   - [Free online Figure Drawing 9][XDQrFoLQrD]
   - To create a strong gesture, it\'s important to keep your arm moving and circulating throughout the page, moving from top to bottom, side to side, very quickly. Start very, very light with marks that barely show on the page. This allows you to make lots of mistakes that will not show later because they\'ll be so light. Develop all of the parts of the drawing together so that you don\'t neglect any area. Try to aim for continuous movements and fluid lines rather than fragmenting your lines into choppy marks. Look at your subject more than you look at your drawing; your subject is where the information is. Keep your gesture drawings about two to five minutes in length, any longer than that it\'s too easy to get lazy and fall back into bad habits.

#### 11. Compile References / Organize Some Studies To Try Out

A few habits you must motivate yourself in doing before every big design task, but also to do in general when you are out of work and waiting on your next job - hone your skills, work on any weaknesses...

Practice your techniques, gather and collect images & materials from a wide range of subjects, and always explore and experiment different methods to improve your draftsmanship:

![image](./images/unnamed_1148.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1066.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_048.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_1170.jpg)
![image](./images/unnamed_392.jpg)

All these were found within minutes of searching online for their various subjects.

When searching for something, add "drawing" ahead of your subject:

- Drawing drapery
- Drawing wings
- Drawing mermaid tails
- Drawing wolves
- Drawing horses
- Drawing swords

It's endless the various subjects you can find and focus on for just a short while.

![image](./images/unnamed_284.jpg)

All the imagery shown above was gathered from Pinterest, as a way to collect various designs and how-to-draw guides for certain topics. Creating reference boards like this for yourself is vital for exploring facets you might be weaker in. Cataloging visual information and saving hundreds of images in neatly organized folders, will help you to learn how to design these subjects in the future by having them at your fingertips for reference.

#### 12. Work Habits

Here is a collection of videos/podcasts on various subjects, from advice on career paths, to tips & tricks for illustrators on learning new techniques: [School of Visual Storytelling][kqTYBePWwT]

Animator, Patrick Smith has some good tips and strategies on healthy work habits and how to set yourself up to efficiently work-from-home: [Staying Productive and Motivated][SeGxKqbAna]

Something to practice \> 'Monk Mode' --- inspired by the disciplined lifestyle of monks --- referring to intense periods of uninterrupted focus to optimize productivity. It involves hyper-concentration on a single task and removing all distractions: [Be Productive with Immersion and Focus][ihoOQvoDgb]

Costume designer, special effects artist, and model-maker Adam Savage has great advice about learning from your mistakes: [Don't Take Things Personally][ymArkHMEQH]

> "Nothing will serve you better than a strong work ethic. Nothing. And it\'s something that you can\'t teach. You have to be thrown into it, where you\'re going to sink or swim." - Robert Downey Jr.

A work ethic is a personal set of values that determines how any employee approaches their work. Artists with strong work ethics are highly motivated and endeavor to produce consistently high-quality results. If YOU feel like you should have a stronger work ethic, then realizing this and staying positive about improving yourself is the first step. Find ways to keep yourself motivated, you will get profound satisfaction from completed work. Procrastination is very very common amongst artists, but keep working on yourself, your skills, your confidence, your goals, and you WILL get better. There's no guaranteed method to ensure productivity, there's no secret formula, you just need to find and discover what works best for YOU. Because all humans work in different ways. You just need to push yourself to keep practicing, don't wait for anyone or anything.

Always absorb the lessons and life experiences of others:

### Pitching

Creating, developing, and presenting your own properties and ideas for an animated series or film is a very big and extensive realm to dive into. Character Design is only one aspect of this grand venture. To successfully develop, pitch and sell your own concept is truly the final frontier and the golden ticket of the entire animation industry, for any artist/creator. There's many books and sites out there that can offer lots of advice on the subject.

You must be ready for the heavy reality that you'll not only need to develop the visuals (or find someone to help you do so) but you must also explore the story development and scriptwriting aspect as well. [Storyboarding][xIkMGgOcIw] is also something to be familiar with, at the very least try it, and learn about how they are made. Especially for animation, storyboards are sort of the second half of the writing process.

> "Always, always invest in yourself, invest in your ideas, and in your passions. Regret can be worse than failure." \- Larry F. Houston

Creating a pitch package can take a long time, and depending how much resources you have, you can create a short and condensed pitch deck that covers the basic concept and visual style like [this][MaPSJElVRT]. Or a long detailed bible that covers all aspects of the character descriptions, art direction, and story outlines like [this][YUNuBoVdhe].

![image](./images/unnamed_1011.png)

#### Writing & Developing

Before you can pitch your idea, you must first develop it, and to develop a concept, you must assemble a pitch deck, to create this you must put together some scripts and plot synopsis, and to do this, you must learn how to write for animation. There's lots to learn when it comes to creating worlds, creating characters, and writing for film or episodic television. Here's some links with a wealth of information to get you started...

For more information about how to develop and pitch your own animated show, read through [Emily Brundige's book][KitPMqHWaY], she skillfully details how to push and expand upon the idea you have, how to think about the extrapolating of your concept, and refining your property so you know who your show is for. She covers how to explain the driving force behind your story engine, the mechanics of the writing process and how to sell your idea to the people you need to convince to help you fund your production.

Story Structure gets complicated to master, here\'s some strategies to start with:

1. Tell a great story
   - This is easier said than done. But nothing matters if you don't have a great story worth telling. A tale you are passionate about. A screenplay worthy of your creativity and devotion.
2. Master the format
   - Anyone can learn the industry standard for margins &amp; overall structure of a screenplay. However, you have to master the subtleties of white space, slug lines, page counts &amp; more. Not to mention the constant threat of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Mastering the format liberates your screenplay of distractions and leaves only the story.
3. No stage directions
   - You are not the director. Leave out camera shots &amp; notes for actors. If something must be seen then skillfully describe it.
4. Show, don't tell
   - The story is revealed through actions and characters. Your exposition shouldn't be obvious to the reader. Show don't tell.
5. Get in late, get out early
   - This rule applies to your entire screenplay but also to individual scenes. Cut out the excess and keep your story focused on what matters most.
6. Know your audience
   - Never lose sight of who you are writing for even if it's yourself. Every screenplay should be a perfect match for the audience it's intended for.
7. Create obstacles
   - Nothing should be easy for your characters. Put them through hell so people will care when (and if) they succeed. There is no suspense without obstacles and avoid cheating by giving them convenient escapes.
8. Clarity
   - Every sentence should communicate an idea (or more than one idea) and it should be crystal clear. Only you can describe what your screenplay is about. Show people the exciting moments that previously existed only in your imagination. Be clear about your character\'s motivations and immerse the reader in your world.
9. Your world, your characters
   - If you don't have the answers, how can you ask the questions that drive your screenplay? What is your world like? Where did your characters come from? What is your story about?
10. Less is more
    - Nearly every rule in this list is related to this rule in some way. Writing with clarity requires a simplification of descriptions. Hiding exposition can sometimes require dialogue to be rewritten and often shortened. Getting into your scenes late and out often, using white space effectively and rewrites in general all point to this one rule. Less is more. Keep it in mind at all times. Make every single word matter and eliminate the ones that slow your screenplay down.
11. Write what you know
    - Writing what you know doesn't necessarily mean you have to write only what you've lived. On the other hand, if you don't know anything about sharks and want to write about sharks... Maybe you should go swim with some sharks! Research is key. A screenwriter is a student of life. Seek out the answers to better inform your story. You have to know every detail.
12. Have something to say
    - You've got a great story, vivid characters and your structure is perfect. You still can't take your screenplay to the next level unless you have something to say. What does your story mean? What is it truly about? You have to know the answers to these questions and build them into every page.
13. Entertain
    - Above all else, your screenplay has to be entertaining. When reading each and every scene in your movie ask yourself one question: Is this entertaining? If the answer is no or not really then you've got some work to do.

- **Create a Compelling Narrative**

  - Show, Don\'t Tell: Don\'t tell the audience that your character is great; show it through their actions and reactions to challenges.
  - Sympathetic vs. Admirable: Focus on making your character engaging and understandable, not just admirable and perfect.
  - Balance Strengths and Weaknesses: Give them genuine strengths but also show what they can\'t do, and ensure their skills have a logical explanation.
  - Avoid universal love: It\'s unrealistic for every character in a story to be head-over-heels for the protagonist. Ensure there are characters who are neutral or even dislike them, which adds depth and realism.

- Give Your Character Real Flaws
  - Imperfections: Instead of \"cute\" flaws like clumsiness, give your character significant, relatable flaws, such as impatience, impulsiveness, or a specific bias.
  - Struggle and Failure: A truly perfect character is boring and unrelatable. Let your character fail, face setbacks, and even question their own abilities, which makes their triumphs more earned.
  - Consequences: Don\'t let your character get away with everything. Their mistakes should have tangible, realistic consequences that force them to learn and grow.
  - A Mary Sue is the nickname given to a character that is unrealistically perfect, typically an idealized female, who possesses no significant flaws, lacks meaningful weaknesses, and is exceptionally skilled in every area. These characters are often criticized as being unrealistic, embodying authorial wish-fulfillment or self-insertion, and existing solely to serve the plot rather than growing through challenges. The male counterpart is known as a Gary Stu or Marty Stu.
  - To avoid writing a Mary Sue, give your character genuine flaws, allow them to fail, make them work for their goals, and avoid making them the perfect, universally beloved center of the story. Ground them in a realistic personality with specific likes and dislikes, provide a believable backstory that informs their motivations, and ensure characters who disagree with them are not automatically bad.

Developing an animated show involves several key stages, from initial concept to final production. This includes brainstorming ideas, crafting a compelling story, designing characters and environments, and finally, creating the animation itself. Effective development also requires a strong understanding of animation principles, storytelling techniques, and the various stages of the production pipeline.

Here\'s a breakdown of the process...

1. **Ideation and Story Development:**
   - **Brainstorming:** Generate a wide range of ideas, focusing on unique concepts, relatable characters, and engaging storylines.
   - **Research and Pre-Production:** Conduct thorough research to refine your ideas, explore potentia audiences, and develop a strong premise.
   - **Story Structure:** Outline the narrative, including a clear beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.
   - **Character Development:** Create compelling and memorable characters with distinct personalities, motivations, and relationships.
   - **Worldbuilding:** Design the visual and thematic world of your show, including its environment, atmosphere, and overall aesthetic.
2. **Pre-Production:**
   - **Scriptwriting:** Develop a detailed script that outlines the dialogue, action, and visual elements of each scene.
   - **Concept Art and Character Design:** Create visual representations of your characters and key locations.
   - **Storyboard:** Translate the script into a visual sequence, using panels to map out the action, camera angles, and shot compositions.
   - **Animatic:** Assemble the storyboard panels into a rough animation, adding preliminary sound and voice acting to test the flow and timing of the show.
3. **Production:**
   - **Animation:** Bring the characters and scenes to life, using 2D or 3D animation techniques, or stop-motion animation.
   - **Backgrounds & FX:** The environments, sets, visual effects, and props that surround the characters and the characters interact with help to make the world they're in and tell the story that they are involved with even further in more believable and tactical ways.
   - **Sound Design:** Add sound effects, music, and voice acting to enhance the visual experience and create a more immersive world.
   - **Compositing and Editing:** Combine all the animated elements, sound, and visual effects to create the final product.
4. **Distribution and Marketing:**
   - **Pitching:** Develop a compelling pitch to showcase your show to potential investors, networks, or distributors.
   - **Distribution:** Explore various avenues for distributing your show, such as television, streaming platforms, or online video sharing websites.
   - **Marketing:** Promote your show to build an audience and generate interest.
5. **Key Considerations:**
   - **Target Audience:** Tailor your show\'s content, style, and tone to resonate with your intended audience.
   - **Animation Principles:** Understand the fundamental principles of animation, such as timing, spacing, squash and stretch, anticipation, performance, color theory, art direction and how to add life to your characters through movement and acting.
   - **Production Pipeline:** Familiarize yourself with the standard stages of animation production and adapt them to your specific project. What style of art direction and animation style best suits your world and story? 2D, 3D, Stop-motion, and how will the production design and technical aspects be developed to match your concept.
   - **Collaboration:** Animation is often a very collaborative process, so be prepared to work with other animators, writers, designers, and sound designers, music composers and even people to manage your budgets, schedules and talent resources.

> "Your authentic voice as a storyteller is the most important thing you've got." - Alex Haley, writer & author

#### Creating a Pitch

1. **Break Down Your Concept**
   - Logline: Create a concise one or two sentence summary of your series that captures its essence and hook.
   - Synopsis: Write a brief overview of the series, including the main characters, setting, and overarching themes.
   - Pilot Script: Prepare a polished pilot episode script, ideally 4 pages long for a 3 min series, or 8-9 pages long for a 7 min series, or 12-14 pages long for a 11 min series, or 24-28 pages long for a 22 min series. Showcasing your writing style and the tone of the series.
2. Create Support Material
   - **Series Bible** - Develop a detailed document that includes:
     - Character descriptions
     - Themes, motifs, and arcs
     - Target audience and market analysis
     - Episode summaries for the first season (and beyond, if applicable)
   - **Visual Elements:** Consider including mood boards, concept art, or reference images that convey the visual style of the show, if possible - Designs for at least all the primary characters and environments.
3. **Research and Networking**
   - **Know Your Audience:** Understand what types of content the company you're pitching to is currently producing and what aligns with their brand.
   - **Networking:** Connect with industry professionals, attend pitch festivals, or use platforms like LinkedIn to find contacts at the company you're pitching to or their production partners.
4. **Craft Your Pitch**
   - **Elevator Pitch:** Prepare a short, engaging pitch that you can deliver quickly. Focus on the unique aspects of your series. Practice how to summarize the entire world, characters, and main themes in a speech, under a minute long.
   - **Full Pitch Presentation** - Be ready to present your series in detail. This would include:
     - The logline and synopsis.
     - Key themes and character dynamics.
     - Why it fits with their current content strategy.
     - Propose original and unique content - Your pitch should focus on fresh and original content. Netflix seeks distinctive narratives that stand out in the saturated market of streaming content. Demonstrate broad appeal and niche interest: Make your content appealing to a wide audience while catering to specific interests.
   - **Practice:** Rehearse your pitch multiple times to ensure clarity and confidence.
5. **Find the Right Contacts**
   - **Representation:** It's often beneficial to have an agent or manager with connections in the industry. They can help you navigate the submission process. Eventually, you may be asked for a Chain of Title and a Certificate of Origin, this is the least fun aspect of the whole process. These are the assets that prove that YOU are the author/artist of this original intellectual property. [Research][gboklmWAvZ] how to produce and collect these materials, as the people you are pitching to will need evidence that this is indeed your concept if they wish to proceed with developing the concept further with you.
   - **Direct Submissions:** If you don't have representation, research if they have a formal submission process or look for opportunities through contests or industry events.​​ Often the company won't accept unsolicited pitch submissions, unless there's a contest or online submission process on their sites to go through. If you can't find a way to contact an executive directly, you will need to find an entertainment lawyer or agent to represent you - Research reputable literary agencies and entertainment law firms, and reach out to them with a query letter introducing yourself and your project. Attend industry events and conferences to network and make connections with professionals who may be able to represent you or refer you to others.
     - [How To Pitch Your Show][QchHaTjXWI]
6. **Follow Up**
   - After pitching, follow up with your contact (if applicable) to express gratitude and to keep the conversation going. Be professional and patient, as decisions can take time.
7. **Be Open to Feedback**
   - Be prepared to receive constructive criticism or suggestions for changes. Flexibility can be crucial in the development process. It's not very common to receive feedback, don't expect it, and no need to ask for it, they will give you advice if they feel the need.
8. **Stay Informed & Be Authentic**
   - Keep up with your broadcaster's content strategy and any announcements regarding their programming to tailor your pitch accordingly. Authenticity and passion for your project can resonate with decision-makers.

#### Pitching Summary

Pitching a series takes lots of preparation, research, and networking. By presenting a well-developed concept and demonstrating an understanding of that producer's vision or studio's content vision, you can increase your chances of success. When pitching a TV series keep in mind that you are pitching a \"world\". A world in which there are an endless amount of stories to be told. Then you get to enter a mini-production phase, to make a sizzle reel, or [teaser,][boARRTIqCW] or [short pilot][tTvNtMhGUy] of your fully [realized idea][pcHzGDTwcw] to test out how it looks and feels. Then that gets reviewed by executives, to see if the proof of concept is ready to go to full series, or if more development or changes need to happen. There's also the art of adapting an already-existing property to be re-made in animated form, that means you need to learn about [option agreements][obrtFFSLku].

Remember, they are more interested in YOU, than your actual idea. You must convince them that if your concept is green lit to go into production that YOU would be able to handle all the problem-solving aspects and any technical or creative obstacles that would come your way. They need to know that YOU would be able to handle the mountain of responsibility that comes with being the showrunner for your own series/film. They are not picking your idea because they think it's a strong idea for their next animated property. They are picking you because they believe YOU can develop and follow-through your concept into full production and successfully complete.

### Epilogue

#### That's it

If you had fun doing the assignments (in the sense that it felt creative, informative, liberating, and not a chore to do) then this might be your calling. Keep pursuing this, keep pushing yourself, keep practicing, keep applying to animation or video game studios (even if they don't have job postings), and you'll soon find yourself earning a living doing this work. You can also create characters of your own, in your own style, and show the stages of progression in your online portfolio. Stay focused on your tasks and the growth of your skills. Stay committed to the work, and always remain devoted to the production you are in. Your efforts will pay off, the growth of your expertise and your value as an employee will rise the more you dedicate yourself to the craft!

Repetition is the master of all skill. Always seek out ways to better yourself, because you're only in competition with your own self, never with others- slow, steady, consistent progress is the secret.

> **Never say:** "How did they do that?" \-- **Always ask:** "How do I do that?"

If you would like MORE character design projects to practice various styles with, simply go back to **Assignments 5,7,8,9,10,11,12** and choose a different property from those you haven't tried yet. In this document there's 32 styles in all, but feel free to search out other old or modern character designs from all the various series & movies out there. Delve into as many as you can, and practice drawing other styles, there's hundreds more to choose from, and LEARN from.

> Places like [Art of Animation: Design References][OPXShmsFih], [Living Lines Library][sCZROdyIls], and the [Character Design Visual Library][tgjDEpYWfg] have endless amounts of design work from other properties to use as reference, simply create your OWN assignments and studies to expand your portfolio, do not stop practicing!

![image](./images/unnamed_521.jpg)

Improve quickly by **copying / drawing-over** & **breaking down** all the model sheets, concept art, illustrations, production design images and character poses you can find - it's all for educational purposes. It's the one true way to accelerate your learning, and improve your draftsmanship. But copy to learn, not to use. Don't claim these trace-offs as your own creations, but use them for practice and self-improvement.

Your brain will inherently know and learn the patterns of shapes, contours, and forms you draw to create these images, and it will benefit your instinctive art skills in meaningful ways. Draw and Copy other people's work to learn from them, break them down and analyze them, then you will unconsciously learn how to incorporate their techniques into your own work.

Then, when creating your **own designs** - DON'T JUST COPY... If you really like the style of a certain show or illustrator, try to incorporate aspects of it... without just mimicking the EXACT STYLE. Try to create a design that FEELS inspired by other things... but it shouldn't read as fanart. Trace and Copy the styles you need to learn from in the beginning, to figure out what makes them work, then draw your own version. Figure out what aspects of the design style make it unique and fresh to YOU, then put your own voice in there. With all this said - always listen to those who make sense to you, follow the code of those that inspire you, consider the words of advice from [Gabby Caldera][LRhwoSdCqV].
