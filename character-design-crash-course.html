<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here is an intuitive, straight-forward approach to self-directed
character design practice for illustrators and animation artists. In
this document you’ll find a series of exercises, each one is presented
with a particular design style to reference, there’s instructions to
follow, and guides for you to create a new character that matches that
style.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1545.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1447.png" alt="image" /></p>
<!-- 👈👈👈 Quick links to each topic and chapter in the left column. -->
<p>Further down you’ll see the setup for these <strong>12
assignments</strong>, with a total of 32 different established design
styles to learn from. For each assignment you’ll have a section called
‘Support Material’, these are external links to design packs, tutorials,
and articles aimed at giving you more knowledge on certain topics from a
wide range of sources. There’s also some insightful character design
history scattered through this site.</p>
<p>If you already know all about how <strong>design sheets</strong>
work, along with the process and theory behind making them, and you just
want to get straight to the practice exercises, then skip ahead to <a
href="#assignment-1">Assignment# 1</a> and get straight to work!
Otherwise, keep reading</p>
<p>through the chapters below, to learn about the essential foundations
and techniques behind the craft of character design for animation.</p>

<p>This document is for learning &amp; self-training in the art and
process of character design. Throughout your career you will upgrade
those fundamentals with new and relevant techniques. Just like learning
the piano, cooking, standup-comedy, or carpentry - you begin with the
foundational skills, and you build up from there. Over time, with
practice, you will gain more applicable and significant skill sets to
add in your toolbelt. There’s also hundreds of external links on this
site that lead you to various tutorials for you to watch, listen, read
and learn from.</p>
<p>To be a character designer for TV/film animation, you must be able to
diversify into a variety of art styles. This course is specific to 2D
animation, however, most of these methods and techniques also apply to
character design for 3D/CG productions, video game development, toy
design, stop-motion films, and any other type of series &amp; shorts for
animated commercials, streaming, and media projects.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1456.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By reverse-engineering a wide assortment of different character
designs, you begin to develop fast and efficient analytical skills for
knowing how to replicate a new character in the chosen visual style.
This way you become more proficient in creating new characters in
whatever design style that is needed for the production. You will begin
to develop instincts on how to blend styles together and therefore
create new styles for any productions in the future. The more you do
this with different techniques, the more you start to recognize the
patterns and arrangements used to create these designs. You will get
faster at figuring out what makes a design work and how to reproduce
it.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-the-character-designer-do">What Does The Character
Designer Do?</h3>
<p>Character designers visualize and create the look of individual
characters. They work from descriptions given to them by the art
director, showrunner, or creative producer. These might include notes on
a character’s personality as well as physical traits. Early concept art
or visual development work or online research/imagery may be used as
reference or springboards to work from. They communicate the characters’
personalities through their artwork of facial expressions, costuming,
anatomy, scale/proportions, and physical poses.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_386.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By Adam Fay</p>
<p>Character designers also carry out research into exploring the
anatomy and costuming of characters. They discover and use anything they
can to inform their work. This role relies heavily on drawing ability,
characters can be drawn on paper but usually created digitally,
especially in the later stages and for their final format. Character
designers create a variety of designs, usually including multiple
versions for a single character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_101.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the beginning, character designers take inspiration from the
script, character descriptions from the pitch deck, insight from the
creator(s), and any provided concept art, using this to create the
characters they’re working on. They present these versions to the
director or producer and address any of their feedback to achieve a
result that they are happy with. In the early stages, very loose and
rough quick sketches are made to ascertain where the design
sensibilities may be, to essentially rehearse some visual concepts. Then
they receive notes and comments to further narrow down the designs so
they can be refined and eventually finalized.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_575.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Character designers create entire casts of characters that all must
share the same aesthetics and look to have them all consistently appear
to be from the same world.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By Rune Bennicke</p>
<p>Once a rough design has been completed &amp; approved, character
designers create model sheets, which show the character from different
angles. In 3D animation, these will be used by the modelers as their
guide to create the character sculpts and builds. In traditional
animation, the animator uses the model sheets as reference to ensure
each frame of animation is “on model” as the character is re-drawn frame
by frame. In 2D puppet/rigged animation, the builders use the model
sheets as direct reference to assemble and produce a finished rig for
animators to use in their scenes to animate with. Storyboard artists
will also refer to these designs while they visualize the scripts, to
incorporate the models into their work as they lay out all the
scenes.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-character-designer-good-at">What is a Character
Designer good at?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drawing:</strong> have a strong level of artistic and
technical skill, be able to create work in a variety of styles showing a
high attention to detail</li>
<li><strong>Creativity:</strong> use your imagination to come up with
original and innovative ideas both for the artistic part of the designs
and for resourceful problem-solving, and create work that sparks the
director’s imagination which helps to tell a story</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> understand what the director wants
and be able to take and act on feedback to alter your designs, while
working well with other artists and designers</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the Pipeline:</strong> know the capabilities
of the artists and animators that will take your work and use it, create
designs appropriate for the medium and technology used on the production
- be aware of the many design stages &amp; review stages throughout the
process</li>
<li><strong>Watching / Analyzing Animations:</strong> have a passion for
the medium and a love of the industry - it doesn’t matter if the
production is for 2D or 3D/CG or stop-motion, the ability to research,
collect, and gather reference and provide quick sketches is
invaluable</li>

<p>A profession in character design for the animation field demands the
artist to switch into different art direction styles all the time. The
more you attempt and replicate other artists’ design styles, the more
you start to recognize the patterns and similarities that exist in all
styles of production design for TV/film animation, and gradually you
learn to apply elements of these learned styles &amp; absorb the
contents of your collected visual libraries to your own tool belt and
skill sets.</p>
<p>Designing an animated character involves several steps. Begin with a
concept that defines the character's personality, traits, and role in
the story. Sketch out these rough ideas to explore different looks and
explore various features. Refine the design with attention to
proportions, details, and unique traits that make the character stand
out.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_215.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Analyzing character art styles and re-creating them to match that
same look, is the best way to accelerate the growth of your
draftsmanship and your personal artistic range. This type of practice is
the most efficient way to develop a long career as a designer and
character development artist in animation. Improving your artistic skill
levels comes with strong commitment and hundreds of hours of dedicated
practice.</p>
<p>As we go through this process of <a

tracing, breaking down, researching, analyzing and then producing
designs of your own in these established styles - it will have you
unlock advancements in your personal artistic growth and you will
unconsciously absorb and learn new techniques.</p>

<p>To help find and develop YOUR own style, you must first explore and
test drive many others, as Skottie Young mentions <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMfxlZACPbm/?igsh%3DMXZoeDl1dHVpc2dwag%253D%253D&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864643479&amp;usg=AOvVaw1of8CuFr-Pqz2AvF5gRegV">here</a>.
There’s no single one perfect method to learn how to be a character
designer. Follow your instincts, along with the opinions, experiences
and instructions from various other artists. It’s up to you to work
hard, learn from other people’s path, their mistakes, their advice,
their wisdom, how they learned, what their approach is, and then
discover what works best for you, by simply doing it, and practicing
it.</p>

<p>The word ‘process’ appears over 100 times in this document, and for
good reason, because for YOU as a designer, it’s arguably more important
than the final product itself. This course will guide you along the way,
showing you how to self-train and self-improve as an artist, putting you
on the road to becoming a well-rounded and sought-after
<strong>character designer</strong>.</p>

<p>Character designers can be employed by the head of production or the
animation studio’s producer, and they can be hired as freelancers,
part-timers, full-timers, or as a more permanent resident of the studio,
but usually (like all productions) it is contract-based work, where the
length of your term depends on the design work available for the
department you’re in.</p>

<p>Being aware of the basics of how animation works is a good head start
for being an effective character designer:</p>

<p>Like many aspects of animation, similar to storyboarding and writing,
character design can feel like a fairly solitary job. Sort of like
solving a large puzzle, you navigate through the process, trying many
different things, until gradually, things start to look right, and feel
right. Where some of the pieces seem to fit together, you start to make
progress after many hours or days of experimenting and exploring, only
to have some setbacks, and realize and it still isn’t quite working.
Until finally you have that “aha!” moment, it can hit suddenly, when you
and others realize that it’s working and the design is coming
together.</p>

<p>There can be times where a client/director loves your first or second
attempt, other times, you have lots of people needing to provide their
input, opinions, and approvals, so it can take dozens of tries, with
many, many versions before you slowly refine things to a final design.
The work can sometimes feel very collaborative, other times very
isolated. The end goals are always the same, to capture the essence of
the character’s personality in visual form.</p>

<p>To know <strong>HOW</strong> to break the rules, we must first
<strong>KNOW</strong> the rules, and know them well. But most
importantly; learning the principles makes you see how other characters
are conceptualized and constructed. While learning their structure,
visual language and the methods behind how they are built - you will
inherit new techniques for achieving more striking and appealing
designs. There's no better way to learn than by
<strong><em>doing</em></strong>, so let's get started.</p>
<p>First off, let’s grasp the language used in the process of Character
Design for Animation…</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-model-sheet">What is a Model Sheet?</h3>
<p>A character design sheet, also known as a model sheet, character
board, character rotation, character sheet, character pack, or character
study; is a set of illustrations used as a guide for the appearance,
poses, views, and gestures of an original character in animated
film/series, comics, and video games. These drawings are later used as
guides by storyboard artists, modelers, builders and animators as
reference to bring the characters to life in the scenes the characters
appear in.</p>
<p>To help get you started, here are a few tips on constructing
character model sheets!</p>

<p><strong>Character Sheets</strong> like these are a specific
industry-standard format that communicates the design of a character. It
can also be used to introduce potential investors to a cast of
characters, tell us a little bit about their personalities and
relationships, and give us a general sense of what the character looks
like and how they might move or behave. These sorts of Character Model
Sheets are used in virtually every entertainment field from game design
to animation. As shown above, there can be many different types of
templates, every studio/production has their own preference. There’s no
right or wrong way to make these sheets, as long as the information is
there and clearly presented. Though they can be used in a variety of
fields, all character sheets contain roughly the same information:
Turnaround views, Expressions, Poses, and sometimes Color. They can go
from very simple to quite detailed and elaborate.</p>

<p>Model sheets also show variations for different states for the
character, most often for changes on hair style and
clothing/costuming:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_066.png" alt="image" /> <img

of the character, along with various angles and poses as well:</p>

src="./images/unnamed_514.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>These model sheets are like visual guide documents, they are
typically illustrated during the pre-production phase of a production
for a film or animated series. In feature films, the concept art and
visual development stage eventually lead to more final character design
sheets to be properly made for the Builds team to use later on. In
animated series, the design process is continuous throughout the
production since there’s many stages across each episode that needs to
be made.</p>

<p>For a TV/media animated series there’s an on-going episodic design
process, as new sets of character sheets are made for each new story as
the scripts get written. When working collaboratively with art directors
or production designers, all the characters in the film or series should
have their own model sheet created by the character designer. Depending
on how large scale the production is, this could be just one or two
individuals creating the main characters, or it can be a whole team of
artists working together to illustrate a large cast of characters. With
multiple episodes always overlapping and many aspects of the design
process needing to be made for each character, like <em>Turnaround
Views, Expressions, Poses, Head Angles, Mouth Charts</em> and
<em>Color</em> - there can be lots of coordination and organization
needed in order to meet the needs of the production, along with a strict
list of weekly deadlines for each episode to keep everything always
progressing forward and on track with the schedule.</p>

<p><strong>How to use a Model Sheet</strong>:</p>
<p>Character design sheets should be used as a guide for any members of
the creative team who will need to work with the character. They should
have a simple layout that is easy to understand without too much
clutter. When it comes to drawing characters for design sheets, it is
important that you keep things relatively neat to avoid any
inconsistencies in the characters’ design further down the line. When
you begin to develop and conceptualize your character, you’re free to be
very rough and messy. Once things get refined and polished off, the
model sheets are meant to display a more clean, formal and official
version of how the character looks.</p>

<h4 id="purpose-of-model-sheets">Purpose of Model Sheets</h4>
<p>Model sheets are visual reference guides used in animation to ensure
consistency in a character's appearance, proportions, and gestures
across multiple artists and scenes. They provide a standardized visual
style, including various angles, poses, and expressions.</p>
<p>Model sheets were first created in the 1930s, once animation
production began to be truly developed as a pipeline for the first time.
Where artists with certain specialties had specific tasks within the
departments they were in. In animated 2D feature films often times the
supervising animator for a character would be heavily involved in their
character’s design.</p>

<p><strong>Key Purposes of Model Sheets</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency and Standardization:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Model sheets ensure all artists working on a project understand and
adhere to the same character design, preventing inconsistencies in
appearance and scale.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Visual Reference:</strong>
<ul>
<li>They act as a visual blueprint, detailing the character's structure,
proportions, attire, and even smaller elements like hands and feet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate Range:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Model sheets can show a character's basic range of facial
expressions and typical poses to reveal personality and aid in animating
specific actions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Character Turnarounds:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple views (front, side, 3/4, back) are included to show the
character's design from every necessary angle, which is essential for
360-degree representation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Guidance for Multiple Artists:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In large productions with numerous artists, model sheets are
critical for unifying the collective effort, making it look as though
one artist created all the character art.</li>

<p>How do animated TV shows and movies keep a consistent art style with
so many different animators?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before any animator starts working there are lots and lots of model
sheets created for each character that gives every single detail about
how they should look and feel, so the animators know how to keep it
consistent. Character Model Sheets are essential for consistency and
provide a guide to artists. Ideally, producers, directors, animation
directors, art directors or lead animators will work to maintain
consistency in the artwork. To stay “on model” is the name of the game,
and most professional, serious artists in the industry have strong
draftsmanship and can capture character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1421.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Normally, animators are split into teams working on a particular
character on 2D animated feature films. That way, an animator just has
to coordinate with a small team, not every other animator on the film.
Those animators are chosen for their particular strengths. Some
animators are really great with animating animals, for instance. Some
are better animating male characters. For each character there is a lead
animator who is in charge of coordinating their team. To the trained
eye, on both feature films and television shows, you can see the
individual artists’ styles creep in.</p>
<p>In TV/streaming animated series, usually animators are assigned
specific scenes or sequences of scenes at a time and they need to
animate everything within that scene, minus 3D props or 2D
traditionally-animated FX, but otherwise, all characters within all
their scenes. Sometimes on more hybrid series (that have more

separate passes on each designated scene, one team for just the key
posing part of the animation and another team for in the inbetweens

can newbie hand drawn animation artists make their art look professional
and smooth like realistic animation?</strong></a></p>
<p>Professional traditional animators, and I mean the very good ones,
started animating when they were teenagers and drawing even younger. For
many artists, animators included, art is an obsession that starts early
in life. By the time they’ve graduated high school and college, and
become professionals, they already have thousands of hours of <a

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You also have to consider that high end animation is a chain process
that involves several steps. The person that draws the poses/keyframes
might not be the same person that draws the in-betweens, and is not the
person that cleans, inks and paints. You might be looking at one frame
of animation not realizing it is the combined work of 3 or 4 artists. So
there’s a lot of work and technique in professional-looking
animation.</p>
<p>What you can do is use a technique called <a
href="https://youtu.be/FUO_QnMg9tU?list%3DPLLhOnau-tupRP_UtUTVqBeidW00_sFFPh&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864678356&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ab0-J4pUxkeVWWTbKVtqe">limited
animation</a>, in which you make fewer drawings per second and/or hold
poses with minimal movement for lengths of time. You separate the
elements of an animated character in different layers, like the body
from the arms, the mouth, the eyes, and animate only the elements
needed. For example, if the character is talking you want to animate the
mouth and perhaps the eyes but you don’t need to redraw the entire body
on every frame. You can get away with drawing the body once and using
that same drawing for many seconds at a time. That gives you the
opportunity to draw a very good character that will stay on for a long
time and save time by only animating the mouth.</p>

<p>As you can see, there can be many variations of how model sheets can
look.</p>
<p>The visual style of the production and its technical limitations will
determine in what level of detail the designs have to be expanded and
elaborated upon. The more <a

<p><strong>Rigged Animation:</strong></p>
<p>This style of animation requires animators to create a <a

rig</a> of their character. This is done by illustrating all of the
characters’ body parts and props on different layers and attaching them
together to create joints, also known as <em>2D Puppet
Animation</em>.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_058.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed.gif" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_074.gif" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_016.gif" alt="image" /></p>
<p>All the elements and body parts are drawn digitally, piece by piece,
assembled and built together as computer generated artwork that can be
moved and manipulated around, just like puppetting a <a

<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1654.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_510.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>For the most part, rigged characters are meant to look, move, and
feel as close to traditionally animated characters as possible, they
simply have libraries of pre-designed body parts for animators to call
upon, cycle through, and use and controllers to be able to puppeteer the
character with virtual bones, joints, and handles to navigate the build
with.</p>

<p>When it comes to designing for 2D animation, keeping your designs
relatively simple is the best way to ensure an easy conversion to
animation. However, technology and software for allowing complex designs
to be still well-animated are being improved every year.</p>
<p><strong>Example of simple vs complex:</strong></p>

<p>When possible, small details that do not add much to a character’s
personality should be removed during this simplification process.
Sometimes the client/showrunner/art director has requirements that need
to be met, so there can be lots of versions and revisions made in order
to fine-tune the designs to be to everyone’s liking.</p>

<h5 id="creating-a-character-model-sheet-for-3d-animation">Creating a
Character Model Sheet for 3D Animation</h5>
<p>Creating a character model sheet for 3D/CGI animation is nearly
identical to the process for 2D with only a few key differences. To help
the artists who will be creating the 3D model of your character design,
it is best to illustrate characters in a T-pose, displaying both the
line art version and the color version as separate images. This is
because the character modeler will import the design into their CGI
software as a guide, so the character’s outlines need to be easily
visible, UV mapping and shading comes later for the coloring portion of
the modeling. As you’ll see from the samples below, certain details on
angles and views need to be shown in more precise details, so the
sculpting of the 3D model can be built more accurately.</p>

is more common in designing characters for 3D animation since the
modeling aspect of translating the designs into sculpted builds requires
the character to have the arms stretched outwards to properly set up

<h3 id="research-preparation">Research &amp; Preparation</h3>
<p>The start of any foray into character design begins with plenty of
research and rough sketching, then more research and more sketching.
Whether you’re creating a character entirely on your own from
imagination, or you’re designing characters for someone else - you will
need to start gathering and collecting info and producing material for
yourself to use as a starting-off point.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, as a character designer, you’re working off of a chosen
design style, this is your reference to start from, you must LEARN this
style in order to create NEW characters that fit with this established
look.</p>
<p>But other times you have to start from scratch, with an empty canvas,
a blank page, the style is not created yet, and it’s up to you to FIND
that style. So you must discover it for yourself and you need to start
somewhere…</p>

<p>Sometimes your client can begin with specific concepts in mind - for
example, you can get a note saying <em>“We are looking for a Vin Vogel
type of style, let’s start there…”</em>.</p>
<p>It makes your job easy in the beginning, because you have a place to
start. Right away, your research has a <strong>target look</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_326.png" alt="image" />

<p>You search up Vin Vogel’s illustrations ☝️ and his picture books,
then make a few dozen sketches inspired by this imagery.</p>
<p>Create new rough character drawings according to your client’s specs.
Begin exploring and work your way towards more refined designs.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1337.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1096.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Other times, just getting started can be more challenging - your
client/director isn’t sure where to begin, they can be vague and
ambiguous, only knowing the age or gender or only having a short
description of the personalities &amp; backstories of the cast of
characters you’re meant to design. That’s when YOU find some images of
many different styles to present them, and ask which ones inspire them
most.</p>
<p>Once you get those answers, then you can narrow the focus of your
research and do rough sketches with a bit more direction. If they still
don’t have much information to give you, then you begin with a broad and
wide range of styles; grab imagery online, make an image board (some
call it a mood board or look board), and present it to your client. This
may take several attempts to narrow down the focus of a design style
that appeals to them. You don’t have to start sketching anything until
they point out to you which styles they find most appropriate. With the
feedback you get from them, you now have a place to start.</p>
<p>In your <a

journey</a> you’ll discover other similar art styles that you can use as
additional inspiration. For example, in this case, the looser and
sketchier designs of <em>Fred Blunt</em> might have aspects you could
use:</p>

</figure>
<p>After 100+ years of illustrated and animated characters to have as
potential reference, there are countless styles to be inspired from.
Often you’ll need to borrow aspects from several ones and combine them,
to develop something original and to match any descriptions given to
you, but creating image boards like these can have your client begin to
pick which ones they prefer most, and then you have somewhere to
start.</p>
<h4 id="preliminary-process">Preliminary Process</h4>
<p>It’s time for information gathering - There’s a few approaches to
take for the research and discovery phase of your original character
design. The first, which may feel the most satisfying and fun to many of
us, is brainstorming (to figure out what it is you are looking for). The
second is to really dive in with an intensive research and study. The
third, is to create a mood board or reference sheet for yourself, this
is a collection of visual themes and imagery that connects with you and
the character you’re trying to create (especially if you are really
starting from scratch). This could mean spending some time on stock
image sites like Google Images or searching through artists’ portfolio
sites like Art Station, DeviantArt and the big one… Pinterest (examples:

<p>The most memorable characters are the ones that make an impression,
so getting their individual attributes and personalities correct is key,
and this can take lots of experimenting and trials-and-error to get
there. Think about some of your favorite characters from movies,
television, internet and literature — they all started as an idea,
perhaps partially based off of a real person the author/creator knew,
and was then developed and visualized with careful intention and hard
work.</p>

<p><strong>How a Character’s Choice of Clothing Benefits the
Story.</strong></p>
<p>When writing or designing a character, it’s important that everything
you include serves a purpose. The character’s name, their favorite
color, and their choice of companion give an impression about the
character, the world around them, and the past that shaped who they are.
The more you amplify these elements, the greater the image you’re
painting for the reader and to the viewer.</p>
<p>For example, say the plot calls for the character to buy a car, and
they choose a blue one. “Blue” is a necessary detail to include in the
narrative, but by giving this specific decision meaning, you make it
important. Perhaps blue was their parent’s favorite color, and they
strive to please them. Perhaps blue is a calming color, and it reflects
their calm personality. This makes the narrative richer.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1150.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the same way that characters have ways to emote and show their
feelings with their faces and body language, characters also need
clothing (at least most of them do), so why not make it a useful element
in the story? Take advantage of this opportunity to tell the reader
something. Here are three things showing how your character’s choice of
clothing can be used to amplify the story.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>It Says Something About Their Personality:</strong> The way
a character dresses can reflect their tastes, views, and emotions. For
example, your boisterous character might be best dressed in colorful
shorty shorts to reflect her free spirit. Her sass and disregard for
other’s opinions is what tells us her personality, but this small
addition has made the fact visual as well as mental. In another case,
your reserved and slightly distrustful character might be better dressed
in a bulky designer coat; this reflects on his desire to be enclosed but
also regarded as superior. Your character’s personality is independent,
but the proper clothing can complement and amplify their unique
views.</li>
<li><strong>It Says Something About The Setting:</strong> Dressing your
characters in clothing that reflects their setting will reinforce this
new atmosphere in the reader’s mind. Colors give impressions all on
their own; dark colors such as greys or blacks will match the dark
atmospheres. If you’re trying to show a contrast between two groups -
one more successful and the other starving - dressing one group in
bright pinks or yellows will give a sense of light and energy, making
them seem healthier. The style also reflects the world; conservative
dress such as long sleeves or coats can reflect order or oppression,
while less conservative clothing can show rebellion and freedom. Your
world itself will determine the setting, but clothing can complement it,
amplifying the atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>It Can Say Something About Them Physically:</strong> In
addition to symbolism, clothing can serve a literal purpose. If you have
a young character, dressing them in outfits which are colorful and airy
can complement their younger attitudes. If you have a character with an
embarrassing scar or injury they wish to hide, constantly dressing them
in long sleeves, despite weather, can subtly reveal this. These details
can amplify the characters themselves but also open new doors for
foreshadowing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every detail included in your design should serve a purpose, and
perhaps even tell a story within a story. Seemingly minor aspects such
as a character’s style of clothes and hair, or the choice of colors in
their outfits, can breathe new life into the details of your
narrative.</p>

<p>An option to explore sometimes is to create a mood board (inspiration
boards / reference boards). These are the perfect place to work out what
the foundation of your design style could be. Knowing basic details
about your characters will help you create references for your image
board throughout the writing or drawing process - and will keep you
focused in the direction you need to go towards for creating believable
characters.</p>

it doesn’t have to be super detailed. If someone else created the
character, then find out what their backstory is by asking them (the
writer/creator/director) of the production. But if you are creating this
character entirely on your own, then start with a few words or short
sentences. Write a summary of their personality traits and history, it
can be point form, with a list of traits, or write a short blurb about
who they are. This can be a simple chart about who this character is and
try to capture their key essence. What kind of character do you want to
bring to life? What kind of character do you need to tell your
particular story?</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_566.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Some questions you want to ask yourself are:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How old are they?</li>
<li>Where are they from?</li>
<li>What do they like?</li>
<li>Are they shy, fierce, serious, goofy?</li>
<li>What do they sound like?</li>
<li>What do they do in their free time?</li>
<li>What kind of music do they listen to?</li>
<li>What does this person’s day look like?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions can change also, just as the
character’s appearance will evolve before the time comes that the final
design is done and approved, so too can the character’s personality.
Whether this is a character entirely of your own creation, or from the
mind of your client/boss - either way, answering these sorts of
questions will help inform your decisions in how to <a
href="https://youtu.be/6XUWE2c9Omo&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864713786&amp;usg=AOvVaw2A-qj0-fZNcgnB2KeNPJAT">visualize
your character</a>.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1425.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_292.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The character’s backstory will give us ideas of what makes them
unique and what kind of wardrobe/accessories they could have. This will
also make the development for poses and attitude drawings flow more
naturally and convincingly later on. Asking these kinds of questions
before you start researching and designing allows for a better
understanding of your character and their personality/history. It’s also
possible that all you’ll have to go by is a written paragraph describing
the character, or maybe even a brief conversation with the creator.</p>
<p>When reading a script you are using for the information found in it
to help you gain insight on your character’s personality. To get you
started, you will be searching for characterizations and clues to their
disposition and attitude. What is an example of <a
href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-characterization-definition/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864714914&amp;usg=AOvVaw2NetQZp7227SKzX5OddD8I">characterization</a>?
Direct characterization tells the script reader about the character -
what they look like, their personality traits, what they like, what they
dislike, and their appearance. For example, an author may write:
"Charlotte was a frizzy-haired bookworm." In just a few words we have a
hint of their personality and physical attributes.</p>
<p>Characterisation by definition: The making of a character by
constructing a description of the distinctive nature or features of
someone or something.</p>
<p>Visual characterization is the process through which an artist
communicates a character’s appearance to an audience. In writing,
characterization is achieved through dialogue, actions, and descriptions
- In animation, illustration, video games, it is achieved through the
character’s design and physical representation.</p>

<li><strong>You start with the personality.</strong> Once that’s done
it’s relatively easier to know what they look like. You sculpt and pick
virtues and vices, flaws and qualities — <strong>perfect characters are
not interesting</strong>. When it comes to protagonists and antagonists,
they’re neither 100% good nor 100% bad, because there are not fully good
or bad people. Get what I’m saying? Round characters are the thing we’re
going for. <strong>Take details from people in real life, if you
want:</strong> funny habits, mannerisms, what makes people
<em>human</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Work on the appearance of your character.</strong> What’s
their body type, their eye color, skin color, hair color, shape of their
face/nose, if they have birthmarks or scars somewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Pick a name as you see fit.</strong> This can be the first
step depending on how you work. Is there a meaning behind it? Does it
somehow show their character’s personality? Remember sometimes they are
relevant to the setting/genre.</li>
<li><strong>Flesh. ’Em. Out.</strong> Think of hobbies and
background/history. How’s the relationship with their family and
friends, how they act around authority, what kinds of clothes they like
to wear…</li>
<li><strong>Always remember:</strong> character development is an
ongoing thing. You never “finish” <a

your character</a>, just like we, as people, don’t stay the same.</li>
</ol>
<p>Focus on Authenticity</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Realistic Personality:</strong> Give your character a unique
personality with likes, dislikes, quirks, and firm opinions, rather than
a generic"wise and courageous heroine" archetype.</li>
<li><strong>Believable Backstory:</strong> Provide a backstory, even if
tragic, that actually explains the character's current state and
motivations, rather than being a generic detail.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Self-Inserts:</strong> Don't create a character that
is a thinly veiled version of yourself. Instead, aim for
multi-dimensional characters with both virtues and vices.</li>

<p><strong>The 3 Categories:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Characters -</strong> The main characters of the
story, seen the most often on-screen, they drive the plot forward, we
follow them on their journey, we see the narrative through their point
of view, the show is about them or revolves around their actions.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Characters -</strong> The supporting cast, seen
less often, recurring characters in the story, sometimes they can have
as much dialogue or screen-presence as the main characters, but they
play a supporting role to the primary cast.</li>
<li><strong>Incidental Characters -</strong> Background characters, the
focus is rarely on them, these could be pedestrians walking in the
distance, random civilians populating the scenery, and citizens in
crowds or scattered around in the backdrop of the scene. In live-action,
these are referred to as Extras.</li>
</ul>

styles:</em></p>

<p><strong>The 4 main types of characters:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Static characters</strong> are characters who never change
during a story.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic characters</strong> are characters who go through an
inner change within a story.</li>
<li><strong>Flat characters</strong> are underdeveloped, one-dimensional
characters without a layered backstory, no motivations, or internal
conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Round characters</strong> are characters with well-developed
strengths, weaknesses, goals, and relatable flaws.</li>
</ol>
<p>A "character arc" is the transformation or inner journey a character
undergoes throughout a story, where they start as one type of person and
gradually change into a different version of themselves due to the
events and challenges they face within the narrative. Not all characters
will have an arc.</p>
<p><strong>Static vs. Dynamic is a different dichotomy than Round
vs. Flat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Static vs. dynamic</em> refers to whether or not a character
changed and evolved throughout the story.</li>
<li><em>Round vs. flat</em> refers to whether or not a character has
depth and layered characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting off with these foundations can help you distinguish your
character development and properly balance their stories in more
satisfying ways. From here, you branch out into other categories, like
choosing their archetype…</p>
<p><strong>Archetypes for Memorable Characters:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Hero or Warrior:</strong> A brave and confident
character who is working to help a cause. Heroes are typically the main
character and you will see a lot of square shape language in their
designs. This archetype is perfect for characters that stand out and
really care about protecting others. An alternative would also be the
Everyman, this archetype is ideal for helping the reader or audience see
themselves in the story. These types of characters are ordinary people,
often thrown into extraordinary circumstances. These protagonists don't
need to have any special talents and are often reluctant to continue
their journey, even though it's usually the right thing to do. They are
often Humble, Sympathetic, Overwhelmed, Quietly Courageous.

<li><em>The Incredibles</em> (2004)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Rebel or Outlaw:</strong> A character who is talented
but who may not work for any cause or dislikes authority figures. This
type of character is often known as an anti-hero, the anti-hero, a
character who lacks traditional characteristics that are associated with
a conventional hero. While typically guided by the best of intentions,
the anti-hero is a classically flawed character with a history of bad
decisions and a questionable moral code. They still really stand out but
can often be more morally gray than your typical hero/protagonist. You
will see a lot more triangular shape language used in this archetype.

are also options to explore, while the classic are more of the
conventional villain.

<li><strong>The Explorer:</strong> These characters are rugged,

possibilities!

</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Creator or The Innocent:</strong> An inventive and
creative character - often nerdy and introverted. This character style
will typically have a combination of curves and angular shape language.
It is also common for creators to have an exaggerated, large head size
to communicate their intellectuality. Traits - Driven, Asocial, Fixated,
Perfectionist. An alternative in this category is The Orphan, another
widely used archetype that's fairly easy to spot. <strong>The
Orphan</strong> doesn't have to be a child, although it's common that
they are. This character type doesn't even have to lose his or her
parents to be an Orphan in this sense. Sometimes Orphans have abusive or
absentee parents and are looking for the “family” that they can be happy
with.

<li><strong>The Ruler:</strong> A leader character who is focused on
maintaining order. This archetype usually depicts a controlling
character with very strong features. Shape language for these characters
can vary, however, square shape language is always a solid foundation.
An alternative is also, <strong>The Leader</strong>, they are a
well-known archetype that often mixes well with others, such as the Hero
and the Warrior. The Leader has a goal and a plan to get there, which
makes for conflict when something happens to derail the character from
his or her goal. Leaders have the ability to inspire action in others.
Since power attracts all types, the Leader can come as a hero or a
villain.

relief</a> character with a quirky often endearing appearance. This is
another archetype where you can experiment with exaggeration! Jester’s
design will often veer away from the confines of the ideal beauty
standard in a way that can be both comical and comforting. As an
alternative, this can also be The Trickster or The Sidekick, always a
staunch ally, supporting sidekick characters come in all shapes and
sizes. You've seen them as robots, humans, pet animals, and supernatural
creatures. Helpful, Devoted, Humorous, Loyal (sometimes to a fault).

using features that are usually associated with society’s beauty ideals
can be a good place to start.

<p>Trends in storytelling and character development for archetypes have
evolved over time. There are many other classes to explore and choose
from, see <a
href="https://scottjeffrey.com/archetypes-list/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864731792&amp;usg=AOvVaw3o3K0Ep9wN2Cnv0EUhN4N4">here</a>

for more stock character archetypes.</p>
<p>Other classifications that often overlap many of the identities
outlined above are <strong>The Protagonist</strong> and <strong>The
Antagonist</strong>, these are usually the two central characters of a
story. A protagonist is the main point-of-view character, while the
antagonist is the opposing force who stands in the way of the
protagonist's goals. The protagonist is often the hero of the story,
while the antagonist is usually the villain. These are usually tied to
one or several types of <a

found within the core of the story.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On a deeper level, you must always ask yourself - what does your
character represent within the story and world that is being shown? Are
they symbolizing a thing or abstraction as a person? For example -
Personification allegory is a type of allegory in which a fictional
character represents a concept or a type. Symbolic allegory is one in
which a character or material thing is not merely a transparent vehicle
for an idea. Often these concepts are not for the designer to decide
upon, but rather they should have these concepts described to them, to
help in the discovery process of visualizing the character. If you are
the creator of this story and the world they live in, or helping to
develop it with others, then these are factors you may want to consider
- since it could affect the look of your character design.</p>
<p>A classic example of a personification allegory is the character
"Everyman" from the medieval play of the same name, where "Everyman"
represents the universal human experience and embodies concepts like
mortality, virtue, and sin, essentially giving human qualities to an
abstract idea like "the average person." In symbolic allegory, the
characters have an autonomous narrative outside of the messages they
convey. The character Virgil in Dante's Divine Comedy, from 1320, is a
symbolic allegorical figure because he represents both the historical
author of the Aeneid and the human faculty of reason.</p>
<p><strong>The Art of Personification.</strong></p>
<p>It was long common in the visual arts to use human figures to
represent a range of natural phenomena, personal qualities, abstract
conceptions, and so on. The ancient Greeks and Romans have literature
and mythologies depicting these; many of their gods and goddesses
represented their own single things, be it <em>Dawn</em> (Eos, Aurora),
<em>Wisdom</em> (Athena, Minerva), or <em>War</em> (Ares, Mars). In
Roman mythology, Justitia was one of the four Virtues, she was often
portrayed as a stately woman, blindfolded, holding scales and a sword,
each became a personification of that phenomenon or quality or concept,
in this case, Justice. Inspired by classical art, Renaissance painters
and sculptors likewise began producing thousands of artistic
personifications -- <em>Time</em>, or <em>Folly</em>, or
<em>France</em>, or <em>Vice</em>, or <em>Poetry</em>, or the
<em>Americas</em>. And in the 18th century English-speakers began using
the word itself. Today artists are less inclined to such depictions, and
the word gets used more often to describe actual individuals; when we
call someone the personification of style, or greed, or loyalty, we mean
the ideal or epitome and embodiment of that quality.</p>

src="./images/unnamed_1403.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p><strong>Who is the Demographic?</strong></p>
<p>When you design a character, it is important to know who your
audience is. For example, a design that appeals to young children may
not always appeal to adults. So before you start your design, take a
moment to think about your audience (and the target demographic of the
production they’re in. How old are they? Are they aimed at any gender in
particular? Answering these questions will allow you to cater your
designs more toward your audience and therefore ensure your character is
more engaging for them, making the property more successful.</p>
<p><em>The Main Categories:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Preschool (3-5)</li>
<li>Bridge (5-7)</li>
<li>Kids (6-11)</li>
<li>Co-viewing/Teen</li>
<li>Adults</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to classify the audience age groups is with the <a
href="https://rating-system.fandom.com/wiki/TV_Parental_Guidelines&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864737434&amp;usg=AOvVaw18gY5hsy4bVQtyJ6VABuvw">rating
system</a> found in media and video game guidelines:</p>

<img src="./images/unnamed_962.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>What is the Genre?</strong></p>
<p>The world and story your characters will be placed in will directly
affect the style they will be visualized in, the environments will
influence the look of your final character designs and their look will
also influence the design style of the world they’re in. A dark animated
horror film for adults will have a very different aesthetic to the
design work compared to a whimsical adventure series for preschool kids.
For example, here’s a the main genres:</p>
<p><strong>Comedy, Action, Drama, Fantasy, Thriller, Adventure, Mystery,
Science Fiction, Musical, Educational.</strong></p>
<p>There are several sub-genres as well, and you can mix these up too,
most series and films are categorized with at least two combined.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rick and Morty</strong> is considered to be Science-Fiction
/ Action / Comedy (and even Dark Comedy)</li>
<li><strong>Over the Garden Wall</strong> could be known as Fantasy with
brief elements of Horror / Comedy / Musical / Drama</li>
<li><strong>Gravity Falls</strong> is seen as Adventure / Mystery /
Comedy</li>
<li><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</strong> is described as Action
/ Adventure</li>
<li><strong>Bluey</strong> is known for being an Educational /
Comedy</li>
<li><strong>The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</strong> is a
Supernatural / Comedy / Slapstick / Surreal Humor</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining these isn’t too important (and not usually your job as the
designer), just be aware that knowing the Genre and Demographic can give
you an idea of what the art direction might look like. Sometimes you
dive into it and you accidentally discover what’s most appropriate for
the character, and this can influence or change the intended personality
and art direction as well. Your client or director should be the one to
provide you with this sort of information. If you are working alone and
creating the character entirely yourself, then determining what the
Genre and Demographic is for this world and its characters can help to
get you started on the look of your characters. If you only have to go
off of a script or text descriptions, then re-read it often, to get as
much info and inspiration from it as you can.</p>
<p>Sometimes subverting the look of the character designs is the goal as
well; like the series <em>Drawn Together</em>, purposefully mixed
various styles, but was a series made for a mature/adult audience.
<em>Gumball</em>, mixes styles too, and it’s made for kids 6-11, however
<em>Smiling Friends</em> mixes styles in a similar way but is intended
more for teens &amp; adult audiences. Some terms and examples of mixing
styles together are on display <a

styles you may need to refer to later. Doing this makes certain you’ve
considered all your possibilities before starting another round of rough

<p>When diving into the researching process, think about how to find
some images for attitudes, hairstyles, costumes and ideas on portraying
your characters physically. Look around for any design inspiration you
can find. The deeper you dig, the more you can find imagery that can
influence your choices in the right direction. Let’s say you’re required
to design a <em>group of pretentious high school girls…</em></p>

<p>Rough Exploration Sketches by Brittany Meyers</p>
<p>Think like you are casting for a movie. Look at real people or photos
and take notes on what makes that person them. Everyone is different -
they have their own stories, tastes, habits, body shapes, and
attitudes.</p>
<p>Everyone has different charms in their own way, and paying attention
and capturing these details in your characters will make them feel
genuine and unique.</p>

You’d be surprised how important it is to really think through and plan
your designs before you get started. It’s extremely important and helps
you avoid problems that could show up later, and also discover things
that can really enhance and bring out the best in your potential
designs.</p>
<p><strong>Thumbnails</strong> is a term used in many areas, like
roughing out poses for animation:</p>

<p>In Character Design, thumbnails are all the small rough sketches made
to hash out your ideas.</p>
<p>While you are collecting references and preparing the info you need,
you will begin to have an idea of what you want this character to
represent. Start making lots of thumbnails by sketching the character(s)
you have in mind, but keep your sketches very loose and <a

<p><strong>‘Roughs’</strong> can mean different things to different
artists. For example, animation director Glen Keane is known for drawing
VERY rough:</p>

<p><strong>Rough Drawings</strong> tend to be not as rough as
Thumbnails, but are not Clean/Final Lines either. It’s always your
personal preference for how rough you want to be, everyone has their own
style on how they produce ‘roughs’, there’s no right or wrong method,
whatever you feel most comfortable with. Many artists/directors have
varying opinions on this, but it doesn’t matter too much anyways, as
long as the IDEAS are clear and presentable. Producers and art directors
all have their own preferences for how many stages to take between
thumbnails/concept to clean+color, and how rough or final they’d like to
see designs delivered and presented as. Simply go with their requests
and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1380.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_397.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1292.png" alt="image" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thumbnails</strong> are VERY loose and sketchy, it’s lines
and shapes that are searching for something.</li>
<li><strong>Roughs</strong> have most of the details and structure
present, they also look fast &amp; scratchy, but all the shapes and
volumes are in there.</li>
<li><strong>Tie-downs</strong> are cleaner than roughs, they’re almost
final lines but not quite, all the details are there.</li>
<li><strong>Clean-up/Line art</strong> has all the final lines laid
down, the lines are refined to the weight and style needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can say there’s no difference in the volume of these two circles
(shown below) and you wouldn’t be wrong. The one on the right is
two-dimensional and so is the one on the left. What is important is what
you do not see — the thought process behind the lines—that helps you to
create more dimensional sketches with flow to them.</p>

<img src="./images/unnamed_492.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>Don’t get caught up with the details in the beginning; this is the
moment to play with proportions and shapes and see what feels right for
the character. Try to come up with a lot of variety at this stage.</p>

<p>Always start off very loose and rough, then draw over your own work,
over and over to refine and shape the character. <a

is NOT about⁠ refinement. The darker lines show your “decision lines” and
the lighter “searching lines” become less important. ⁠</p>

<p><strong>Quantity will find quality:</strong> When starting a sketch,
be sure to draw quickly and confidently. Gloss over mistakes and don’t
spend too much time erasing. If you’re not happy with the way your
drawing is going, just start a new layer to build something fresh or
iterate again. Through this process, something will eventually click and
you’ll know when things feel right. A lot of the time you may not know
what you want to draw until it’s directly in front of your eyeballs.</p>

<p>For example, the story about the <strong>pottery teacher</strong> is
a parable about the importance of quantity over quality when learning
something new. The original version was told by photographer Jerry
Uelsmann to motivate his <em>Introduction to Photography</em> students
at the University of Florida. The story was later retold in the book
<em>Art &amp; Fear</em> by David Bayles and Ted Orland, while the art
medium changed from photography to ceramics.</p>
<p>In the story, a pottery teacher splits his class into two groups and
gives each group a different assignment…</p>
<p>Group A: Make one pot per day for 30 days</p>
<p>Group B: Work on only one pot for the entire 30 days</p>
<p>At the end of the month, the teacher judges the quality of the pots
and finds that the highest quality pots came from Group A, the group
that made 30 pots quickly. The teacher explains that by focusing on
quantity, the students were able to learn from their mistakes and
steadily improve their skills. They made 29 pots, one at a time,
learning from their faults and missteps, they had to work fast, having
to complete one per day, and by the last pot, #30, they had refined
their process to create a well-made pot. The students in Group B, on the
other hand, became paralyzed by perfection and were left with little to
show for their efforts, even though they had a whole 30 days to perfect
the one attempt at a single pot.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that <strong>quantity leads to
quality</strong>, and that it's better to create and improve over time
than to focus solely on perfect quality from the start.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do thumbnailing, but it is always meant to

ideas</a> as a visual rehearsal. They can also be just blocks and blobs
and simple silhouettes, or quick gesture drawings made of squiggly
lines, or just various shapes and forms to see what works and what
doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Keep spending time researching and discovering plenty of imagery to
inspire you, go online, find the types of design aesthetics, costumes,
and environment that your character will be in. Compile lots of
references, then start by roughing out some concepts of what the
character should look like, explore and experiment with loose &amp;
quick sketches. All of this will help you to learn in a more <a

way</a>. A well-researched character will have a lot more credibility
and really resonate with their audience. When you are finished
researching, you should have enough reference material to start
designing your character.</p>

<p>Digital sketching is a low-stake scenario, so try not to stress too
much about drawing. It’s okay to make mistakes in the beginning. Embrace
it and try not to worry about the details. The main goal when doing
initial rough sketches is to jot down your wild ideas and then build
upon them afterwards. It can look like senseless blobs, but as long as
it makes sense to you, you’re doing the right thing.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_371.png" alt="image" /> <img

<p><strong>Once you’ve created lots of thumbnails:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revisit your most successful sketches and refine them further</li>
<li>Pull together the most compelling visual elements into a definitive
design</li>
</ul>
<p>After all this sketching, ideally you create something that you want
to push further. At this point you can create a new layer in your
drawing program, while also lowering the <em>opacity</em> of the
previous one, so you can easily draw on top of it. It’s important to
stay loose and to not stiffen up when starting a “cleaner” drawing.
Strengthen the design and the shapes you already put forth. In the past
I often strayed too far from the sketch and became unhappy with the
drawing. You chose to move forward with your sketch for a reason, so
don’t disregard it too much when fleshing it out.</p>
<h4 id="shape-language">Shape Language</h4>
<p>There are three basic shapes in your toolbelt: round, box, and
triangle. If you follow your intuition, each shape conveys a
personality. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Round</strong> = charismatic, harmless, endearing, friendly,
soft, cute, innocent (circles, ovals, eggs, beans)</li>
<li><strong>Box</strong> = reliable, uniform, traditional, stable,
balanced - (squares, rectangles)</li>
<li><strong>Triangle</strong> = movement, harmony, cunning, dynamic,
competent (downward pointing more aggressive or villainous)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_229.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<ul>
<li>Shapes can also be <strong>combined</strong> for more complex
characters</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1362.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There’s a variety of other combinations/variations like
diamond-shaped, tear-drop-shaped, oval/egg-shaped, hourglass-shaped, and
bean-shaped.</p>

<p>When we deconstruct visual images, most objects will break down into
one or more familiar shapes, each carrying their own visual signposts.
See how the characters from <strong><em>Pixar’s Up</em></strong> can be
visually broken down to <a

<p>As you can see from the images above, it can help to think of the
human body as a series of relatively <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWr1dktFAhKo&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864766458&amp;usg=AOvVaw35Zm7zItHHXCbk9wPG322Q">simple
shapes</a> when you are starting your design.</p>
<p>Squares and rectangles are reliable, rigid and sturdy, possibly
stubborn/unchanging too. Visually they’re used to symbolize order and
robustness. Think of a robot or a heavyset man, which are often
represented by rectangles in <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qNnF6uJITtI?feature%3Dshare&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864766844&amp;usg=AOvVaw1JRPf8fkWtujQ6snFGFnRl">caricature</a>,
and note the correlation of sturdiness to each one.</p>
<p>Circles (and ovals, ellipses, egg-shape) are friendly, harmless and
fun. Due to the continuous nature of the line in a circle, they also
represent progress and synergy. Animated characters made up of the
circular look are generally protagonists, though sometimes bumbling or
innocuous ones at that. Think about the Powerpuff Girls, Homer Simpson
and Santa. Babies, teddy bears, dopey types and jolly characters all
fall under this category of cuddly, friendly circular fun.</p>
<p>Triangles are dynamic shapes, indicating both balance and energy.
Down-pointing triangles are used in character design for fit, active
characters: think of the V-shaped chest of an athletic character, or the
classic hourglass figure of a femme fatale which is largely a series of
triangles stacked on top of one another.</p>

<p>The shapes that make up the character can symbolize what they
represent or give hints as to their personality, background and
alignment. Combining shapes together will have their own visual
significance depending on their arrangement. A rectangle and triangle
together can make a house or an arrow, just as a character design with a
rectangular body and circular head could be a dimwitted lackey (large
rectangle, small circle) or a mega-mind genius (thin rectangle, large
circle). Of course, you can always flip the tables to play with
expectations. Maybe the small circular little girl is the powerful
dynamo, or the stocky square guy turns out to be unstable and
hyperactive.</p>

<h3 id="exploration-sketches">Exploration Sketches</h3>
<p>A character designer is the artist responsible for conceptualizing
and designing all of the characters in an animated production. Sometimes
you are given a predetermined style to follow, and therefore very little
reference searching is required of you. Other times, a lengthy process
of exploration studies at the very beginning is made to discover what
the style should be. This specific branch of the design team focuses on
using comprehension of design language as well as their considerable
draftsmanship skills to create new characters based upon the stories and
descriptions provided to you.</p>

<p>When you first try to experiment with what your character might look
like, produce some rough drawings that allow you to rehearse, explore
and discover a variety of shapes, sizes, and proportions to see what
feels best. This stage is often referred to as Concept Design or
Predesign.</p>

<p>Character Development or Visual Development (<strong>VisDev</strong>)
is what many artists and producers will also call these stages.</p>
<p>In the <strong>writing</strong> stages; Character development is the
process of creating and evolving the personalities, motivations, goals,
and emotions of your animated characters. It involves defining their
traits, flaws, strengths, weaknesses, relationships, and arcs.</p>
<p>The designers do their best to visualize these concepts,
materializing them into a character.</p>
<p>This is one of the most creative parts of the entire production
process.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_595.png" alt="image" /> <img

src="./images/unnamed_347.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1024.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>These initial <strong>research drawing andrough sketching</strong>
stages are all about the visual character development process. Creating
and evolving the look of your animated characters, first through
research than LOTS of sketches. It involves defining their shape
language and visualizing their personality, from the lead characters to
supporting cast. All with the purpose to drive the narrative and engage
the audience on an emotional level. A well-designed character possesses
a strong visual aesthetic that instantly captivates the eye. This is not
easy to achieve, but through lots of practice, you’ll get better and
better at nailing it down sooner and sooner.</p>
<p>Reference. Reference. Reference.</p>

<p>You’ll see and hear about <strong>character development</strong> -
which can be a broad term, often you are not only trying to figure out
what the characters look like, but also WHO they are and what their
personalities are. As you construct their design it is easy to see how
much the personality description and writings obviously influence the
evolution of their design, but then the designs can also have an affect
on their personality as well.</p>
<p>Similar to how a television actor is influenced by the writings in
the scripts they read, what their character does, how they do the things
they do, and what they are told to say as dialogue, all shape what the
character they are meant to portray. The actor studies the written
material, has discussions with writers, directors, producers about
performance choices. But the actor themself adds and subtracts their own
opinions and qualities to the behaviours, mannerisms and quirks that the
character has. Inevitably evolving the character persona into something
different than what the original intentions might have been.</p>

<p>These preliminary sketches can be referred to as the
<strong>Concept</strong> stages of the characters’ visual development.
Where several variations and iterations of the characters are drawn up,
assembled together so you and others can compare them against each
other, sometimes you mix and match and swap out traits and body parts to
assemble pieces together from various designs to see what might work.
Usually these can be very rough to start with, all made to visually
explore and see what feels best.</p>

<p>☝️ “You need to be smart with where you spend time. If you focus on
detailing everything, things can become overly cluttered quickly. You
can see that this elephant warrior has a lot of implied details. The
lines on the elephant’s core wrap around its form. Although this is
rather simplistic, it gives you a good idea of what the armor can look
like with just a few strokes of the pen. There are also scribbles on the
deltoid armor pieces and in the elbows, implying some kind of sigil or
crest. All of these”details” are conveyed with minimal work.” -Erik

<p>As you can see from all these examples, this stage of visual
development for character concepts is all about trying out lots of
different things, to see what looks good, and what works best for the
character’s function and personality and the story/themes being
portrayed. Sometimes color concepts are asked for as well to be mixed in
with the roughs, especially when there’s one being fine-tuned to be the
final possible design.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1575.png" alt="image" /> <img

<p>These sketches can explore variations of the same design with color
concepts included to provide some options and clearer representation of
how the character would look, colors are easy to replace later, they’re
not meant to be final quite yet, just a way to see the tones and how
they could possibly work.</p>

<p>Roughing out exploration sketches like these will help you to
discover what style you (or your client / director / producer) may be
looking for, and allows you to figure out how the anatomy and mechanics
of your character may work. In addition, you figure out the strengths
and weaknesses in the design, see what the patterns are in the nuts and
bolts of the design and what makes it work.</p>

some options to arrive at the ideal solutions and get closer to the look
you’re all searching for.</p>

<p>Shapes, forms, proportions, anatomy, costuming and many other aspects
of “style” must be experimented with. The word itself,
<strong>style</strong>, appears nearly 500 times in this document -
because it has such a broad definition that covers many aspects of
visual art. Once certain parts of a character are nailed down, there may
still be other aspects that need further exploration. Usually <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/s9sonPCrNcg?feature%3Dshare&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864811986&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hnZ8TxswKL8xvleWfub-e">clothes</a>
and hair are specific areas that can be further explored separately to
show many more possible varieties, to see what feels best. As they say
with actors; the hair styles, make-up and costume choices help to define
the characters:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1258.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_011.jpg" alt="image" /> <img

<p>Just like an actor, <strong>costuming</strong> and <strong>hair
styling</strong> alone can be an entirely grand and long venture to
embark upon to discover the many outfits your character can have and
which costume should be their default. However, with over 40 years of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864813604&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_a8zT29IYFS24k4Maa2L4">The
Simpsons</a>, you’ll notice they’ve worn the same clothes the whole
time. The reason for this is because it can be difficult in the
production pipeline to change a character’s outfits, it’s more efficient
to keep them usually the same as often as possible, when you have a
large crew of animators across several studios producing a series.</p>

<h4 id="concept-art">Concept Art</h4>
<p>Exploration drawings (shown above), along with research drawings,
visual development art, character development art, predesign art and
concept art - all serve the same purpose, and they can be black and
white, rough, clean, or color - but these can all be considered the
<em>conceptual stage</em> of design. Sometimes concept art is loose and
rough character sketches, sometimes it’s full color, or mixtures of
rough colors thrown in with some greyscale tonal studies, or just rough
black-and-white line art. It can have roughly painted environments
integrated with them, displaying what a snapshot of a scene could look
like (color keys or lighting keys), fully illustrated with the character
placed in a location. Concept Art is simply short for “<em>Conceptual
Artwork</em>”.</p>

Francoeur</a> explains: Chris Sanders’ development work on <strong>Lilo
&amp; Stitch</strong> is a masterclass in unified vision—where design,
story, and tone emerged from a singular voice. His loose, expressive
linework radiates warmth, roundness, and imperfection, making the
characters feel handmade and emotionally immediate. These weren’t just
sketches; they were the DNA of the film’s identity. Sanders, in
collaboration with Dean DeBlois, carved a heartfelt, offbeat narrative
that broke Disney convention by grounding the story in personal,
familial stakes rather than traditional fairy tale tropes. His clarity
of vision permeated every department. I recall animating a sequence
where the genetic guns blast through the bay doors on the mothership—my
instinct was to have the blasts scatter randomly. Chris paused and said,
“Think of it like a rotating Gatling gun—clockwise, circular.” That
suggestion reframed the entire moment and made the scene work better in
regards to both timing and design. Suddenly, it wasn’t chaos—it was
controlled rhythm. That’s Chris in a nutshell - not just a designer of
characters, but a shaper of moments, bringing purpose and clarity to
even the smallest beat. The film’s enduring charm owes much to that
meticulous yet intuitive touch.</p>

<p>Visual Development, Pre-Design, Concept Design, all interchangeable
terms relating to the process of researching styles, developing the
character art style, creating exploration sketches, and producing color
roughs. It’s all about ‘finding the look’ -- sometimes the style is
already locked in, but you still need to try out lots of different
options to see which one works best with the character’s description and
personality...</p>

<h3 id="character-turnaround">Character Turnaround</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve collected all your references, sketched out lots of
concepts and exploration drawings, and started choosing which roughs to
nail down for the look of your character, based upon any prerequisites
or parameters you might have to follow. You are now beginning to lock
down what it is you (and your supervisor/director/client) are looking
for. You are now ready to get started in producing the actual individual
views of the character design by refining the look and various angles of
the character’s physiology. Here you begin to explore how the structure
and anatomy of the character work, it’s time to begin developing a model
sheet for your character!</p>

<h4 id="the-rotation">The Rotation</h4>
<p>It starts with the 5 basic views, allowing yourself and others to see
how the characters look when rotated and viewed from different
sides.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_444.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To illustrate a character model sheet or turn-around sheet, typically
you will be required to draw your character from 3-5 different angles,
to develop a rotation (or <a

rotation</a>). Depending on how much of a main or primary character they
are in the story, this will determine how many views will need to be
produced, the more present they are in the story, the greater the chance
the animators will need more reference to know what the character looks
like from different sides. Another factor is the style of the animation
(will it require lots of turning or changing perspectives), You may need
5, 8 or even 14 views to fully see the character from all views to
ensure consistency. But to start off, your primary views will typically
include: <strong>front</strong>, <strong>front
three-quarter(3/4)</strong>, <strong>side (profile)</strong>,
<strong>back</strong> and <strong>back three-quarter</strong> views.</p>
<figure>

<p>With the initial 5 views completed, you’ll have the foundation to
create many more.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="draw-the-front-view-of-your-character">1 - Draw the front view
of your character</h5>
<p>The first pose is the frontal view. Your standard turnaround should
have 5-views of the same character: a <strong>front view</strong>, a
<strong>back view</strong>, a <strong>side (profile) view</strong>, a
<strong>3/4 front view</strong> and a <strong>3/4 back view</strong>,
these all help modelers/builders and animators better understand the
volume &amp; structure of the character and what details are seen from
various rotations. But a 4-view turnaround works good too, it’s the bare
minimum for most productions, but for asymmetrical characters you may
need up to 8-views to accurately get the full rotation, since the left
and right sides of their bodies aren’t mirrored.</p>

that might be covered up by hair, clothing, or overlapping body
parts:</p>

<img src="./images/unnamed_910.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>A good way to ensure consistency between the different views you will
be drawing next is to use one of the poses as a background, and the
frontal view is the best one to start with.</p>

<h5 id="create-some-guidelines">2 - Create some guidelines</h5>
<p>Once you have your character's frontal view, place some guidelines at
different levels to keep consistency between the poses. These lines will
help the character have the same height throughout the sequence, but
also maintain the proportions of the different parts of its body.</p>
<p>Accuracy in the proportions and positions of all the elements of your
character’s rotation is always important. Creating these guides in
Photoshop is very simple. Just drag the mouse from the document rulers.
Make sure that the "Snap to..." function is not active because it will
make the drawing process difficult.</p>

<p>The 3/4 pose next, using the front view as a template. Imagine what
the features of the character would look like if they were a little
tilted. The nose and other facial features will have to be altered
slightly and not quite in the same position. The shoulders, symmetrical
in the front view, will now change and have slightly different sizes.
The legs will no longer be the same size, either. One will be wider than
the other because it will be closer to the imaginary point of view.</p>

<p>Once you have made the first approach to drawing the new 3/4 pose, do
the flipping or mirroring method. It will be easier to see if something
doesn't have the proportions it should.</p>
<p>It's essential to pay attention to the feet and the relationship with
the ground and make sure they don't appear to be shifted.</p>

will gradually curve slightly downwards. See <a

<p>All characters follow some sort of perspective rules, same as any
geometric shapes:</p>

src="./images/unnamed_714.png" alt="image" /> <img

<p>Notice the ground plane that the character designs stand on,
sometimes it’s flat, like they’re standing on a flat line, other times
they are in perspective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pay attention to consistency in foot placement &amp; perspective for
the turn-around views:</p>

<p>Also, in this above example, the camera would be in line with her
eyes, not her waist, this is more common in character sheets with
turnarounds, Notice her collar, sleeves, belt, pants all curve
downwards.</p>
<p>Even when certain character designs only follow their own rules of
flat-graphically-stylized perspective, some ‘cheats’ need to be made to
have the characters look good in whichever views they’re being depicted
in:</p>

<h5 id="check-the-guidelines">4 - Check the guidelines</h5>
<p>Once the first rough drawing of the pose is finished, check the
guidelines to make sure everything aligns properly. Not all of the
elements will at first, but that's ok. Just make adjustments and
corrections as needed.</p>
<p>It is essential to spend a good deal of time on this and check
carefully because it is better to notice any possible mistakes now than
when we are already working with the refined version of the drawing.</p>

turnaround</a> is that each part of your character should line up
exactly in each angle. A good way to make sure you are getting your
proportions correctly is to <a
href="https://youtu.be/3gvdGDc1WWM&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864836495&amp;usg=AOvVaw1h7sJoU3tAS54Ujdw8VXY6">draw
guidelines</a> that correspond with key elements of your character.
Example: top of the head, eyes, nose, mouth, shoulders, and other key
parts of the body and costume, and where the joints are.</p>
<h5 id="draw-the-side-view">5 - Draw the side view</h5>
<p>For the side view, it is crucial to consider that it is the pose that
will show the character's volume, especially for facial features like
the nose or lips. Some designers draw the arm as a separate detail in
this view or raised up so that it doesn’t block what the torso looks
like, but it's up to you. Don't forget, as with the rest of the poses,
to check that every element is properly aligned before refining the
lines of your sketch.</p>
<h5 id="draw-the-back-view-and-34-back-view">6 - Draw the back view and
3/4 back view</h5>
<p>The 3/4 back view might be one of the trickiest poses, but don't
despair. The back view is more straightforward. Just copy the front
view's silhouette and add all the elements in the back of the character.
You may never have considered what your character looks like from
behind, things like how long the hair is, or what decal might be
imprinted on the back of their sweater, for example. These are important
details in a turnaround because modelers (builders/riggers) will use
them to achieve a more faithful character reproduction.</p>

<p>Then comes cleaning up the linework and choosing final colors (more
about this later, in the <a href="#color-styling">Color Styling</a>
chapter). Often providing a few different color schemes and variants can
be helpful if you have a producer/director or client needing to do
approvals on your work - offering a few choices can be helpful in
arriving at a consensus for the final color pass.</p>

pass is essentially tracing your rough artwork with a ‘final line’,
ensuring consistency and volumes are maintained. Study other design <a

to learn from other designers' improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Head Angles</strong> are an additional aspect that is common
to include in more detailed model sheets:</p>

src="./images/unnamed_524.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_694.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Head angles can be challenging to do, combinations of cheating the
perspective to make the angle work while still making it “look good” is
key.</p>

<p>Here’s another similar approach to the turnaround process…</p>
<p>Rough out some concepts to discover who your character is for their
look and personality. Produce exploration drawings to find the shapes,
structure, and style you’re going for:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1409.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then refine your character(s) down to a few possible body types:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1030.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Refine and lock down the look and structure of your character. To
make your turnaround views, setup your horizontal lines, use them as
your guide - rough out basic forms:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_512.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1183.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Then a detail pass (roughs) to refine the shapes, make decisions on
anatomy, clothing, hair:</p>

rotation, the volumes and proportions of all body parts relative to one
and other - the position of all details and any revisions and
adjustments you want to make:</p>

also include shading &amp; shadows, if that’s the style you’re going
for:</p>

(or creating one of your own) can have you be more efficient when
reusing the same body types for multiple characters.</p>
<p>Sometimes the drawing of the character in each view is in a different
pose, instead of the standard arms resting on their sides or pointing
outwards in the same postures for each view, this is purely the
preference of the designer and their supervisor/director.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1565.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1000.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Sometimes, all you need is 2 or 3 views because the amount of screen
time they have is short and limited and they do not animate to make full
turns in the scenes they are in. This saves you time by not designing
more views than is needed, the storyboard will show how much they are
moving, so always refer to that. From this information you can determine
how many views are actually required, if there are no <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KxqCSE3J3GM&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864843110&amp;usg=AOvVaw0D0Tokc6muWcBo9QQrsaGZ">storyboards</a>
to reference, then start off with the first view (3/4) and once that is
approved, depending on the time you have and the requirements set out by
your director/supervisor, you complete, 3, 4, 5 point turnaround views
as your time restrictions allows.</p>
<p>When there’s a team of designers, often two views are enough to get
general approvals from all necessary people in the production. A junior
designer or assistant designer then completes all the other views of the
turn. The lead character designer or designer supervisor or art director
then approved the accuracy of the additional turn around views.</p>

<p>5-pt turnarounds are probably the most common set you will produce.
This is because it covers all the basics you need. With these first 5
views, it’s easy to expand to 8 or 12 view rotations.</p>

<p>In 2D animation, most of the time designers need to ‘cheat’ the look
of each individual view since most times they are drawn not how they
would actually look three-dimensionally, but more how they should look
to appear the most appealing from that angle.</p>

<p><strong>How many views must you create for your
character?</strong></p>
<p>This often depends on the production’s needs and even the time
constraints of the schedule. The more primary the character is, the more
screen-time they’ll have, the more views and references need to be
drawn. Usually the script and <a

are a good indicator of how much the character will be present on-screen
for. The more screen-time they have, the more they’ll act and move
around, therefore the more likely you’ll need more views in their
rotation for the model sheets to depict how they’ll look from various
sides. Main characters will be seen the most and will be in the most
episodes (in a series) and therefore will need more references since
more robust and refined builds will need to be made since they will be
doing the most action and <a

<p>It’s just a matter of preference and often what the storyboards will
show to be visible in the shots the characters will appear in. The less
scenes and the less turns they will do, the less likely you will need to
create multiple views for that character.</p>

<p>There’s also an optional 5/8 and 7/8 views (the views between the
Front and 3/4, and between 3/4 and Side), sometimes called <em>Off
Centre Left</em> and <em>Off Center Right</em> (depending on which way
they’re facing) or <em>Front Near Left</em> / <em>Front Near Right</em>,
these are usually reserved for the main cast of characters, since they
get lots more screen-time than incidental or secondary characters.
Adding these inbetween views makes for a more complete rotation,
examples of this further below.</p>
<p>To distinguish between these inbetween views like 5/8 and 7/8.</p>
<p>Remember that 5/8 is between the Front and 3/4, and 7/8 is between
the 3/4 and Side:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_925.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1338.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_172.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Adding in these in-between views creates 10 and 12 point
rotations.</p>
<p><strong>10-point turnarounds:</strong></p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1084.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_508.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_117.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_183.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Even more inbetween views can be made, it all depends on the
production style of the animation, and what is demanded of the
characters in their stories. 12 point Turnarounds can have an additional
view between the Side view and 3/4 Back view as well, or additional view
between the 3/4 Front view and Side view. You could add more inbetween
views for the full rotation, adding up to a 16 point turnaround.</p>
<p><strong>12-point turnarounds:</strong></p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1047.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition, there’s the view between the 3/4 Back and the Back View,
these would be called <strong>5/8 Back View</strong>, as seen here.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1407.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sometimes you will need to create new poses between each main view of
an 8-point rotation, to make it a 16-point turnaround:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_768.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It may seem technical or complicated, but when it comes to adding
more inbetween views; these are actually easier to draw because it's a
very close reference to the views around the ones you’ve already made.
It becomes only a slight rotation change, often reusing the same
artwork, and only shifting and turning the body parts slightly in
perspective to complete these new views.</p>
<p>Turnarounds are not the only type of character model sheet you will
want to create for builds artists and animators to reference. Some other
common design sheets include: Expression Sheets, Pose Sheets, Color
Keys, Hand Models, Mouth Charts, and various Style Guides!</p>
<h3 id="expression-sheets">Expression Sheets</h3>
<p>Creating an expression sheet is a great way to provide the animators
with a basic guide on the way a character expresses different emotions.
Try to include a combination of extreme and subtle expressions in your
illustrations for these model sheets. Expression sheets are super fun to
sketch as you can really explore a range of personalities for your
character.</p>

<p>Depending on the style of the design, your expressions may be
reserved and subtle, or quite exaggerated with lots of squash &amp;
stretch. There’s always a range to experiment with between realism and
cartoony-ness.</p>

<p>Have fun with poses and facial expressions - What you will find
helpful in the design stage is sketching the characters in action
(poses) as well as their facial expressions, to see what feels right and
suits them best. Think about how this character would act in different
situations. What kind of faces do they make when they are happy or
excited or angry?</p>

Angles</a> or Head Charts are sometimes part of the Expressions Sheets,
sometimes part of the Posing Sheets, sometimes they’re a designated
design asset on their own. <a

important reference material for animators:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1209.png" alt="image" /> <img

<p>Breaking down a character design’s expressions can be great learning
practice:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1204.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1115.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1095.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Create your expressions to be unmistakably clear as to what they’re
doing, how they’re feeling, and what is happening. Basically, always
think about producing strong poses &amp; expressions, not ambiguous
ones.</p>
<p>An inspirational example here is some old <em>Tiny Toons</em>
expression sheets. There were some fantastic moments and some incredible
animation shown in this series, and a few times some crazy over-the-top
&amp; hilarious situations were shown. The cartooniest and most
enthusiastic artist on the crew was <strong>Eddie Fitzgerald</strong>.
Here are some of his sketches of the <em>Tiny Toons</em> cast:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1475.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This Buster character looks pretty conservative for Eddie. His
exaggerated style of expressions seem a bit subdued here, but these are
still really good, really pushed, and great inspiration.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_841.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_607.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>There's soooo much to learn from these. It's free, loose, energetic,
and seemingly effortless drawings of expressions and body language.
These show a special love for the character. Late in Eddie’s career, he
actually got to storyboard on the 1999 version of <em>Woody
Woodpecker</em> too.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_221.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Check out these awesome expressions. You have to be a real cartoonist
to realize the creative beauty and humorous potential of Warner Bros'
seemingly most conservative character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_350.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These are some more great poses. It's weird to see Porky wearing
pants, but somehow Eddie manages to draw it well. He knows what people
like about the old Porky Pig character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_618.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You know somebody can really draw if they like to do back poses - and
can make them funny! Many artists are afraid of drawing characters from
the back - not Eddie. He embraces the backside.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1319.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>See how he can get perfectly clear poses, construction and attitudes
in just a few lines on a tiny thumbnail drawing. Eddie's storyboards
would be super fun to lay out, because he's done the hard part for you.
You can't go wrong with appealing poses like this.</p>
<p>Here's some Plucky Duck expressions that look way better being rough
and exaggerated than the final version that got toned-down on
screen.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_889.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Eddie was one of the first directors during the idealistic days of
<em>Tiny Toons</em>' birth in 1989, and he was the perfect choice for
the job. He had a unique vision, a strong individual drawing style and a
really funny way of seeing the world. Plus, he intimately knew all the
original <em>Looney Tunes</em> cartoons that they were basing these baby
versions on.</p>
<p>Use this as inspiration to stay loose in your roughs, be exaggerated,
and use the wild poses/expressions as a starting point, then tone down,
refine, and afterwards, reduce them down to the style and structure they
need to be.</p>
<h3 id="pose-sheets">Pose Sheets</h3>
<p>Similar to expression sheets, pose sheets/action poses are used to
show the type of gestures a character is likely to make. These can be
really important to provide your animators with information on the way a
character moves in accordance with their personality and how far to push
dynamic poses as well. Whilst traditional character turnaround sheets
can feel a bit stiff, pose sheets allow for a much wider range of
motions and body language to be expressed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1257.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Your poses are meant to be the tip of the iceberg, making the
observer wonder: what’s this character’s back story, and giving hints as
to their personality and intentions.</p>

<p><strong>Body language</strong> is a crucial element in character
design, used to convey a character's personality, emotions, and
intentions through posture, gestures, and movement. It's a visual
shorthand that helps audiences understand a character's inner state and
relationship with others, even without dialogue. It's a visual shorthand
that helps audiences understand a character's inner state and
relationship with others, even without dialogue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conveying Personality:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Body language can be used to visually represent a character's
traits. For example, a confident character might have an upright
posture, open body language (like hands on hips with relaxed shoulders),
and a wide stance. A nervous character might slouch, cross their arms,
shoulders up, and have a downcast gaze.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expressing Emotions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Different postures and gestures can indicate various emotions, like
joy, fear, confidence, or doubt. A character lowering or raising their
hands might express fear, while a character with a straight back and
head held high might convey confidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Showing Intentions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Body language can also reveal a character's intentions. For example,
a character leaning forward might indicate they are trying to engage in
conversation, while a character looking away might be trying to avoid
something.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Building Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eye contact and how characters physically relate to each other
(e.g., touching, embracing, or keeping a distance) can also convey the
nature of their relationship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Considering Context:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The context of the scene and the overall style of the project (e.g.,
realistic drama, cartoon comedy) will also influence the type of body
language used. A realistic drama might require subtle and nuanced body
language, while a cartoon comedy might be more exaggerated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Individual Voice:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each character should have their own unique body language,
reflecting their personality and habits. Universal gestures (like
smiling, nodding, or shaking hands) can be supplemented with individual
quirks, like shaking a leg when nervous or avoiding eye contact.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Drawing your characters in various perspectives and angles can be the
most difficult thing to do, especially when the design of your character
is very flat and stylized, they may not be very
“three-dimensionally-friendly”.</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>Pose Sheets</strong> have expressions
illustrated in them as well. Full body poses + facial expressions will
serve as double the information for those using it as reference.</p>

<p><strong>Pushing the pose</strong> doesn’t always mean exaggerating
the gesture to the max - it means that each exaggeration is further
supporting the ‘big idea’ of the pose with readable emotions:</p>

<p>The pose you choose for your character can communicate a lot about
their personality, emotions, and desires. For example, using a concave
(c-shaped,) line of action for your character’s pose can help them seem
timid or sad, whereas a convex curve can be used to make them seem more
confident or happy.</p>
<p>So, before you choose your pose, think about what you want to say
about your character and how you can best illustrate this information
through curves, tilts, and expressions!</p>

<p>Once you have got your pose roughed out, you can start thinking about

your pose is working is to create a silhouette of the pose and see if it

<p>Thumbnail - Rough - Clean-up - Color</p>
<p>The thumbnail/rough stage of posing allows you to see aspects of the
character you couldn’t see before. Look back to what you found out about
the character before you started designing, when researching different
aspects of the character, you’re being purely creative and exploring,
you do a Turnaround but once you start POSING your character, you see
areas in the design that might need to be revisited and tweaked. It’s
like taking your model out for a <em>test drive</em>.</p>
<p>Then you enter the “clean-up” phase where you refine the posing,
correct any issues with <a

volumes and find the final line you want to have.</p>

<p>When posing, start off loose and rough to get a feel of how the
character’s acting and attitudes could come through.</p>
<p>Sometimes pose sheets and expression sheets can be combined, their
purpose is always to show animators and builders/riggers what the range
of anatomy and flexibility is intended for the character’s style, and
how to illustrate various attitudes and postures.</p>
<p>See Victor Navone’s collection of thumbnail sketches <a

He developed these to work out the posing and acting for the characters
in his shots prior to animating his scenes. Created as a way to rehearse
the poses for the best performance and actions, finding the attitude and
mindset of the characters. He’d use these sketches as a way to explore
how to depict their mood and body language.</p>

<p><strong>Variations &amp; Re-dressing:</strong></p>
<p>Often, creating variations in costuming and hair styling can be
common practice before full turnarounds are drawn. This way the director
can see what looks better for the purposes of the story, location, and
the sequence the characters are in.</p>

src="./images/unnamed_867.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Other variations are often designed for extras and secondary or
incidental characters, they serve as background filler and often share
similar interchangeable design traits to keep things efficient and
simple:</p>

<p>By Marta Andreeva</p>
<p>Incidental characters are usually background crowds or random extras
needing to populate the scene, reacting to the events transpiring in the
shots. Sometimes you’re able to re-use body types, interchange clothing,
hair styles and skin tones in order to be more efficient with your time
and to easily add variety amongst a crowd of characters.</p>

src="./images/unnamed_1188.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_937.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Variations in age are more rare, but still a possibility depending on
the story being told with the character. For example, if there will be
flashbacks (or flash-forwards) or visual ways to chronologically depict
the character at various stages in their life, then variants in the
designs to show younger and older versions will be needed. In which
case, displaying the states of their changing physical appearance needs
to be mapped out.</p>

src="./images/unnamed_519.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_744.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Sometimes when developing the character, variations are requested to
make them a bit older or younger, adjusting <a

and hairstyles/clothing can go a long way in showing these
iterations.</p>

<p>Pose sheets can be made up from the drawings created out of
<strong>Character Layouts</strong> and <strong>Special Poses</strong>
too. These are certain moments captured from the storyboards that need
to be redrawn in more details and placed on-style, here’s samples of
this from Marc Bachand:</p>

<h3 id="color-styling">Color Styling</h3>
<p>A <strong>color stylist</strong> (also known as color designers)
chooses the colors for characters, props, and FX in an animated
production.</p>
<p>Using their knowledge of color theory, their skills as a painter, and
their design sensibilities, they create palettes and lighting that
allows the characters to fit within the backgrounds and match the
overall style of the show.</p>
<p>As always, it’s important to remember no two productions are alike,
and the roles of a color stylist can vary greatly from show to show.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_196.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When a color stylist first begins on a show they will receive
information from the Art Director about the style of the show and the
various painting approaches that are employed when coloring the
characters. This is known as a style guide.</p>
<p>Whether an actual document or just a conversation with the Art
Director, the style guide serves to give parameters to the color
stylists to help the character treatments look consistent.</p>
<p>For example, a style guide might say such things as…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The shadows of the characters are always hard edged and so when
you are blocking out shadows, use the lasso tool.”</em></p>

<p>Terms to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hue is color (blue, green, red, etc.)</li>
<li>Chroma is the purity of a color (a high chroma has no added black,
white or gray)</li>
<li>Saturation refers to how strong or weak a color is (high saturation
being strong/vibrant)</li>
<li>Value refers to how light or dark a color is (light having a high
value)</li>
<li>Tones are created by adding gray to a color, making it duller than
the original</li>
<li>Shades are created by adding black to a color, making it darker than
the original</li>
<li>Tints are created by adding white to a color, making it lighter than
the original</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="handout">Handout</h4>
<p>The color stylist’s job begins once the clean black and white
character designs have been approved and turned.</p>
<p>Similar to the other design positions, the color stylist receives
their new assignments from the Art Director along with any caveats or
specific instructions the Art Director would like for the color
scheme.</p>
<p>The Art Director will also give them any context for the
character/scene that may affect color.</p>
<p>Once the Art Director has delegated the designs, it’s off to the
races!</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1067.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_626.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<h4 id="paint-with-all-the-colors">Paint With All The Colors</h4>
<p>While the Art Director may have some specific thoughts about certain
aspects of the character, the color stylist for the most part makes all
of the decisions about the color schemes of the character from hair
color to skin color to outfit color/coordination.</p>
<p>Occasionally there may be characters that directly references or
parody a real person and in these specific cases, the palette might be
pulled from the reference in order to help it as a reference or
something already in existence.</p>

<h4 id="matching-the-backgrounds">Matching The Backgrounds</h4>
<p>Another very important consideration the color designer has to make
is whether the character’s color scheme/treatment will make sense
against the background.</p>
<p>Often, color stylists will bring in the finished backgrounds where
available to make sure that the color scheme of the world and the color
scheme of the character are logical and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1405.png" alt="image" />

<p>Your character colors can clash with the background, it’s always good
to make a quick test to see:</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="color-design-review">Color Design Review</h4>
<p>Once the color stylist has done a few color iterations (usually 3 to
5) of the character in 3/4 front view, it is time for the Art Director
and Showrunner to review.</p>
<p>The Showrunner will pick their preferred color scheme from the line…
or possibly frankenstein pieces from different versions.</p>
<p>For example: The Showrunner may say, <em>“Let’s use the hair from #1,
but the skin tone and outfit from #4”</em></p>
<p>The color design usually goes through two or three reviews before it
is approved.</p>
<p>Once the 3/4 front view colored version of the character is approved,
the color stylist will then go in and paint the rest of the black and
white turn around.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_483.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s a full time job because you have to do that for every single
character, prop, or FX in every single lighting situation that happens
in a show. The character designer(s) on a production can sometimes do
the colors for their own characters. The smaller the production, the
more tasks each artist is made to do. On small productions, a designer
may have to do concepts, roughs, turnarounds, clean-up and colors for
all the design assets they create. While on larger productions, those
tasks could be divided up amongst 4 or 5 different people since there is
such a large amount of characters to do each week, designing characters,
props and color styling ALL of them.</p>

<img src="./images/unnamed_1273.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>Color Design might sound like a relatively simple job, but it’s not.
You have to take into account a lot of things: how the colors will read
on multiple surfaces and backgrounds (and clashing with multiple colors
within one background), when you should have shadows on the model, how
the shadow actually affects the model, why you’re choosing cool colors
or warm colors, how colors look after they’ve been compressed to be seen
on phones versus broadcast TV/streaming, and even the subconscious
meaning of colors culturally/psychologically.</p>

<h4 id="local-colors-and-lighting">Local Colors and Lighting</h4>
<p>Color stylists create and set the character palettes for the
characters, props and FX within an episode, taking into account lighting
changes that might happen while said elements are on screen. Something
that can vary from show to show is whether color stylists are
responsible for doing the light adjustments for characters under
different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Local Colors (the base colors of a character under neutral lighting)
can be greatly impacted by the lighting of specific shots.</p>
<p><em>For example: A scene takes place in a nightclub with neon lights
could turn a brunette character’s hair bright pink or have rim lights
added on.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes color stylists do these lighting passes, and sometimes they
are done by the Art Director.</p>

Tulip is a different color palette in the puzzle car, a different
palette outside, a different palette in the corgi car, a different
palette inside the temple, and a different palette in the foggy area.
Then she has to have a different palette every time she looks at glowing
numbers on her hand in each of those locations. All of that just for one
character, not including any props or lighting that affects other
characters.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown from that pilot episode (note, the colors are
a little washed out because the screenshots were from youtube, but you
can still see the difference):</p>

<p>As you can see, she doesn’t just have a green hoodie, she has like 9
different green hoodies. When eye-dropping these colors, there are
colors in there you don’t even realize were being used in there. These
are all decisions that a color stylist makes.</p>

<p>So <strong>Props</strong> and <strong>FX</strong> need to be colored
as well, keeping the character and background colors in mind while
designing the color palettes, so that they will go well together
side-by-side. Every object that a character touches and every puff of
smoke or falling leaves that might show up in an episode all need to be
designed.</p>

<p>This can vary from show to show, not all productions have the color
stylish responsible for exclusively character colors, it’s common for
them to also do all the colors for other objects and FX. On some
productions, the color stylist is responsible for any color design that
is not a background.</p>
<p>On other productions, there may be a whole other designer for props,
oftentimes a prop designer both creates the designs and colors for all
hand-held objects featured in the series.</p>

<p>Another thing that can improve the effectiveness of your character
design sheet is a color guide! To do this, all you need is a simple key
of all the color swatches used in the character design, alongside an
example illustration of the character in full color. This is really
helpful when you are handing off a design for a whole team of artists to
use, as it ensures all of the colors remain consistent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Digital media gives access to every color out there. While this is
truly amazing, I think limiting yourself to a few key colors is actually
a better strategy. Using a limited color palette helps a sketch feel
cohesive. Using too many colors can sometimes create a sense of
messiness and a lack of focus. I would say to stick with between one and
three primary colors initially. Afterwards, you can dive between the
values of each tone when detailing. I truly believe that color is the
most important piece of the puzzle when creating eye-catching art. I’ve
done a few”tests” on social media. When posting a drawing with no color,
versus the same drawing with added colors, the latter will always get a
stronger reception. So if it vibes with your artistic vision: be bright,
be bold. It also doesn’t hurt to get inspiration from photos or other

<h4 id="right-on-schedule">Right on Schedule</h4>
<p>Similar to both background design and character design, there are
usually about 2 weeks allotted in a production schedule for color design
for each episode, however the timeframe can vary. These 2-week-cycles
include producing the color concepts, having them reviewed, painting the
one view of the character again, having that reviewed, revising those
colors, then painting the other views, at least 5 views for a primary
characters and at least 2 views for a secondary/incidental character,
and usually you are working on two episodes at once, with multiple
characters, with some partial re-use and re-dressing from previous
episodes, and all overlapping at various stages.</p>
<p>Color stylists usually finish around 3 to 4 fully-colored character
turns per day. Sometimes a very extensive character may take more
iterations of exploration.</p>

<h4 id="rim-light-and-rim-shadow">Rim Light and Rim Shadow</h4>
<p>Sometimes you need to make a custom color palette for night time
scenes, which includes creating samples for light sources and how they
are painted.</p>

<h4 id="workflow-pipeline">Workflow Pipeline</h4>
<p>Start off with only coloring one view at a time, you want your color
palette approved before applying it to all the other turns.</p>
<p>Also, if you were not the one that designed the characters (you are
painting someone else’s design) can you communicate with them about
“color details”? - This is the discretion of adding in some highlights
or shading or the removal of lines once the shape is painted.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_049.jpg" alt="image" />

<p>Or the adding of textures or patterns, like this:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1172.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1017.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Because character design can sometimes shift right up until the
episode’s assets go out to the Builds Artists and Scene Setup crew,
sometimes color design can also be tweaked after the design was already
approved. It’s not the norm, but it happens!</p>

<p>Most shows have a level of flexibility and fluidity in their pipeline
to account for changes that may occur along the way.</p>
<p>No pipeline is perfect and TV animation schedules are notoriously
hectic with many many moving parts all working at the same time with
various stages all overlapping each other with many levels of changes
and adjustments being made on every design asset right up until they get
given to the animation crew.</p>

<h4 id="who-do-i-work-with---part-two">Who Do I Work With? - Part
two</h4>
<p>Primarily, color stylists work closest with the Art Director, this is
the person foremost in charge of the overall look of the series.</p>
<p>The Art Director guides and supports the designers to make sure all
the color treatments suit the style of the show.</p>
<p>Color Stylists may communicate with Character Designers to discuss
their black and white designs which are the basis the color stylists
work off of.</p>

<h4 id="who-do-i-affect---part-two">Who Do I Affect? - Part two</h4>
<p>Color Stylists most heavily affect the Builds team, they take the
finished and approved color designs and convert them into rigged assets,
which then goes to the Scene Setup (scene prep) crew to assemble each
individual shot for each sequence of the episode, which then goes to the
animation crew. When the animators open up their assigned scenes, they
see everything has been imported, placed in, sized up and laid out for
them to use, and then they can begin <a

<p>Placing the color exploration designs over the background art of the
location the characters will be at, is usually a great way to see how
the colors will work together. This way you can arrive at the colors
most appropriate for the scene:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_839.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These can be called “color keys” as well, since they give you a
snapshot of what a finished scene would look like.</p>
<p>So the background colors are usually more subject to change since we
want the characters to stay consistent in their personal color
schemes.</p>

<img src="./images/unnamed_199.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>Color explorations are often needed to see which tones and palettes
work best - for the purposes of character personality.</p>
<p>Also, placing your painted character in their environment (if one is
available) is a good way to spot any clashing colors as well, or to
adjust for the possibility of the character blending in with the
background too much.</p>

<p>Sometimes less is more. You can limit the color palette for unity and
impact. When working with three colors, keep the
<strong>60-30-10</strong> rule in mind. Pick one color to make up about
60% of the character, a second color to make up about 30%, and the last
color is about 10%.</p>

<p>Colors have a similar subconscious effect on our visual
interpretation. Creating characters with an appealing and suitable color
palette can make an immediate impact in grabbing and holding a viewer’s
attention. There are a few different aspects of color theory to consider
when designing your character:</p>
<h4 id="symbolism">Symbolism</h4>
<p>Each color carries its own innate effects on a color scheme. Red is
universally alert and energetic, white is universally neutral. Warm
colors are associated with action while cool ones are linked with
calmness.</p>
<p>If you’re creating content for an international audience it’s
worthwhile keeping in mind that different cultures have different views
on color symbolism. Red, for example, can signify danger in the western
world, but happiness in China. Likewise, blue represents freedom in many
parts of Europe, but can symbolize villainy in Japan. Your intended
audience will determine your use of <a

symbolism</a>.</p>
<h4 id="color-relationships">Color Relationships</h4>
<p>The relationship between the different colors in your character
design is just as important, if not more so, than the separate color
significance. Some of the most well-known color arrangements include:
monochromatic (different light values of the same hue); Complementary
(two colors which are directly opposite each other on the color wheel),
Analogous (colors which are adjacent on the color wheel), and Triadic
(three colors spread around the color wheel in a triangle
formation).</p>
<p>Each color scheme and color combo has its own advantages:
monochromatic and analogous palettes are often soothing, complementary
colors are both contrasting and harmonious, while triadic color schemes
are dynamic and rich. Take a look at these color wheels and use these
systems to help find a color scheme that’ll be naturally pleasing to the
eye.</p>

<p>You can see how the character’s colors can showcase their
personalities. How we perceive color’s significance and meaning is both
psychological and cultural.</p>

<h4 id="complementary-colors">Complementary Colors</h4>
<p>Complementary colors are the exact opposite of each other on the
color wheel. This gives a highly contrasting and bold look. If you want
your character to stand out, a complementary color scheme is
perfect!</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_164.jpg" alt="Complementary color scheme" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Complementary color scheme</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see in the below example, the use of complementary colors
for a character design really allows for the details to pop in the
illustration! This can be a useful tool when you are creating a
protagonist who needs to be the focus of your drawing.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1333.jpg"
alt="A character design with complementary color scheme" />@meikearts</p>
<h4 id="monochromatic-colors">Monochromatic Colors</h4>
<p>A monochromatic color scheme uses only the tones, tints, and shades
from a single hue on the color wheel. This creates a really unique and
often emotive look in an illustration. If you are looking to make
relatively simple color choices, this could be the best method for
you!</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_835.jpg" alt="Monocromatic color scheme" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Monocromatic color scheme</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This color scheme is great for creating characters with well-defined
traits that may be best expressed through a specific color. If you have
a very complex character design, monochromatic colors can also help
simplify their appearance and make it more visually appealing.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1192.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A monochromatic color scheme is also a great choice if you are
looking to improve your understanding of values when coloring and
shading your work!</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1143.jpg"
alt="Example of a character in monochromatic color" />@meikearts</p>
<h4 id="triadic-colors">Triadic Colors</h4>
<p>If you are looking to have a bit more variation in your color scheme,
the Triadic method might be just what you need! These color combinations
use 3 colors that are equally spaced apart on the color wheel.</p>
<p>When it comes to using triadic colors, it is best to choose one of
the three to be the most prominent in your illustrations and use the
other 2 for highlighting smaller details.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_195.jpg" alt="Triadic color scheme" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Triadic color scheme</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This color scheme creates a very vibrant look, even when the colors
are toned down. It is best used for characters with playful energy, as
these color combinations can often feel very youthful. This makes
triadic colors perfect for characters aimed at a younger audience!</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_568.jpg"
alt="Example of triadic color scheme" />@meikearts</p>
<h4 id="warm-vs-cool-colors">Warm vs Cool Colors</h4>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_278.jpg" alt="Cool vs Warm Colors" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cool vs Warm Colors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When it comes to using warm vs cool colors there are a few key things
to consider. When added to an illustration, warm colored objects will
typically feel closer to the viewer, whereas cooler ones will feel
further away. This is because of atmospheric perspective, which is
essentially just the effect of particles in the atmosphere making things
further away have a bluish tint.</p>
<p>The color temperature of your characters will have a similar effect,
for example, warmer-colored characters will stand out and feel
confident, whereas cooler-toned characters may appear more closed off
and mysterious.</p>

<p>Remember, sometimes there’s added details that need to be inserted
in. Like rotations of hands, the underneath area of hair, arms, robes,
capes, cloaks and wings, including underneath the feet and the inside of
mouths - these are all factors that need to be designed for certain
productions in order to provide consistent design and color reference
for animators later on.</p>

<p>Also, it’s important to note that even though you can use as many
colors as you want, it is recommended not to span the chromatic variance
of the characters too much due to the simplicity of the models.</p>
<p>Example of the muted color variations found in the characters of
<em>Paranorman</em> from Laika Studios:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_287.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>Muted colors are the opposite of vivid colors, and they are created
by simply adding black, white, or grey to a base color.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1483.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_188.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Dull or muted colors like these, refers to colors that have a low
saturation or chroma.</p>

<p>Other elements to include in color keys (color model sheets) are
night-time color schemes, any semi-transparent elements, and what colors
can be found in their inner sleeves and under their shoes:</p>

<p>Another aspect a color stylist needs to do is to provide alternate
versions of the model (usually close-ups) so that other hard-to-see
areas are made more visibly clear. Insides of mouths, insides of sleeves
and collars, eyelids, and under shoes/feet, just to name a few
examples.</p>
<p>When a whole cast of characters are arranged together, often
adjustments need to be made so that the color schemes for each character
that are often seen together should compliment each other, and not clash
or compete with each other.</p>

<p>In 3DCG animated productions, these color designs are used by
UV/Texture artists to re-create the surfaces &amp; color shaders for the
character models.</p>
<p>There’s many types of color schemes you can create, try out a few
different kinds for your characters to see what works best, experiment
and see which ones match your characters’ personalities too.</p>

<h4 id="advice-for-the-aspiring-color-designer">Advice for the Aspiring
Color Designer</h4>
<p>If you’re interested in becoming a color stylist/designer, here are
some helpful things to keep in mind for both your personal growth and
your portfolio!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Characters and Colors</strong>
<ul>
<li>A strong color design portfolio shows you know how to make clever
and appealing color choices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Embrace the BG</strong>
<ul>
<li>Character color palettes must always exist within a world, having
work in your portfolio that includes a background, and shows you know
how to color key a character to their world in an appealing way. If you
don’t have your own BG to use, grab one from anywhere and BLUR it a lot.
If you’re still not game with that, use a dark gray background, it’s
better than stark white.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Light and Variation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Another exercise that can both help you hone your skills and
showcase them in a portfolio, is doing several color variations of the
same design… as well as doing lighting variations to show a character
under varying lights (example: warm light, cold light, neon light).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Masks Abound</strong>
<ul>
<li>Less of a thing for a portfolio and more of a skill to practice is
utilizing layer masks to cut and color different parts of your character
designs and character linework. While each show will have its own style
guide, getting familiar with the use of layers and masks can make it
easier to transition to designing within a production pipeline. In a TV
production, making changes fast and easily is everything so it’s
important to become acquainted with setting files up in a way that
allows you to color shift quickly if needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reference and Style</strong>
<ul>
<li>An important consideration color stylists make is how to choose
color schemes that are appropriate for the character in the sense of
age, personality, and fashion. Looking up references of different
outfits, palettes and clothing sets will help hone your eye for what
sorts of colors pair nicely and what the effect of such colors have.
Example: More muted, earth tone colors tend to read as “mature” while
brighter colors tend to read more youthful, and black.gray may read as
edgy/dark. The color of an outfit can radically change the way a
character’s personality/attitude will be interpreted.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mouth-charts">Mouth Charts</h3>
<p>For reference for lip sync animation, designs must be made of the
various mouth positions that animators will need for reference. There
are many different ways of going about it, typically there’s anywhere
from 8 to 14 main key positions (for each view) to make.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_076.gif" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Front, 3/4 Front and Side views are the 3 positions to build mouth
charts for.</p>
<p>As with everything, the style of the production will dictate how
exaggerated or subtle the changes in the mouth shapes will be, and how
far to push mouth shapes and expressions. Also, usually there’s a
‘<strong>happy</strong>’ version and a ‘<strong>sad/angry</strong>’
version made for each speaking character, sometimes a third
‘<strong>neutral</strong>’ version as well. For main characters, a
front, side, and 3/4 view is made for each set of mouths as well.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_795.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_718.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_296.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Even with simple/cartoony mouths, keep the character’s anatomy (and
graphic style) in mind, think about what range of squash and stretch you
may need, what are the limitations, many characters need to talk without
teeth as well, many factors need to be considered:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1464.png" alt="image" />

<p>These mouth shape guides are usually the last step in the creation of
a full character model pack, as you can see, different productions have
different codes and slightly different variations on the look for each
syllable.</p>

<h3 id="size-comparison-charts">Size Comparison Charts</h3>
<p>Line up your cast of characters side by side to create a reference
chart for every character’s scale relative to one and other. This is
usually made later on the the design process, once the main/primary
characters of the series or film are made. All other characters and
props created afterwards, use the one main character as the ruler to
visually see the scale for all other designs in comparison. Storyboard
artists and Animators will use these charts as reference throughout the
production.</p>

<h3 id="distance-models">Distance Models</h3>
<p>A less common aspect of character design for animation is creating
‘distance models’. As the name suggests, these are characters that have
been re-designed to have less details so that they are more easily
read-able as they are further away in the distance.</p>
<p>Usually only seen in 2D animated series. Simply shrinking down the
usual design causes the lines to get mashed together, so new custom-made
models for far shots are created, to make a better and more readable
design.</p>
<p>Here’s a typical <strong>turnaround model sheet</strong>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_822.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>And here’s a custom design made for a <strong>Distance
Model</strong>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_136.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So they can be reduced in size and their simplified linework will
make the character more recognizable from afar:</p>

src="./images/unnamed_654.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>These models are made for <strong>Wide Shots/Long Shots</strong>,
when the subject is far away from the camera.</p>
<p>Not every production uses them, but something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>You can also have ‘extra detail’ versions of character models for
close-ups:</p>

<h3 id="style-guides">Style Guides</h3>
<p>Design Guides, Posing Guides, Drawing Guides, Breakdown Sheets,
Construction Models, Style Guides - there’s lots of names for them,
depending on which department creates them, what group they’re for,
which studio produces them, and what sort of production they’re for.
These are becoming more numerous and more frequent in this industry to
be made and used, and usually assembled once characters are all
completed and finalized. The more time there is in the schedule for
them, the more ‘DOs &amp; DONTs’ and ‘How to Draw’ guides are drafted
from the character designs, art directors and sometimes the
showrunners/series directors, to help other artists &amp; animators
understand their construction and mechanics.</p>
<p>For example, here are some DOs &amp; DONTs/breakdown sheets made for
animators to use as reference for the Devil character from the
<em>Cuphead</em> series:</p>

<p>Hand models are a unique aspect of character design in 2D animation.
They are the one item that is difficult to build a library of assets
for, often lots of examples of hand poses are made, but unlike all other
body parts hands are usually drawn out by the animator. Pre-made hands
can be made available in the build for the character, but animators will
need to also custom-make new hands all the time for all the actions,
gestures and acting performed by the characters. Therefore as much
reference as possible should be made for them to use as a guide for how
to draw and pose hands.</p>
<p>Here’s the Style Guides from Pickle and Peanut:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_647.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_870.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_819.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1318.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Sometimes style guides are made to show the rough structure of the
characters, for animators to know the three-dimensional construction of
the characters, to help them re-draw and pose them with consistent
volume, orientation and proportions:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1201.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1250.png" alt="image" /> <img

<p>The internet grows exponentially every year, and now more than ever,
you’ll see old and new design sheets and breakdown sheets like these
becoming available.</p>
<p>If the production is more traditionally-animated in style (<a
href="https://youtu.be/YPM31WZjR3w&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864965057&amp;usg=AOvVaw27EBV1wnc6WBzaZYNyCZBU">hand-drawn</a>),
then there will be more guides produced on how to draw and pose the
characters. If the style is more puppet/cut-out style, then libraries of
pre-drawn body parts are made. The animators pick and choose which body
part and pose they need. Then stop-motion-style, they move and swap the
pieces around frame by frame, therefore much less drawing is
required.</p>

or 'appealing' image. True innovation comes from digging deep into your
character's personality and their role in your story!</p>
<p>It's not too much of an overestimation to say that character design
is one of the most sought after positions for freelancers and studio
artists. Designing characters all day is an amazing, fun and inventive
process that allows for a lot of rough exploration and idea generation,
so it's no wonder that so many people want to pursue it as a career. To
become truly excellent, I believe it's important to weave the
character's central concept/conflict into their visual identity!</p>
<p>I'm not a professional character designer, but I wanted to talk a
little about the way I go about designing my characters and why I do it
that way! Hopefully it will help people avoid some of the common
pitfalls. Please feel free to share your tips and advice in the comments
below, too. I would love to hear your thoughts and techniques!</p>
<h4 id="way-past-cool">Way Past Cool</h4>
<p>The most obvious and common pitfall is designing a character just to
look 'cool'. A character should be designed around a function or
personality! Sonic is designed to look cool, sure - but he is also
designed to be the fastest thing allliiiiiive! Hence the 'blown back'
spikes (from running so fast, obviously) reminiscent of comic speed
lines, his red racing car sneakers, and the endless triangles in his
designs!</p>

<p>You should have known I would use Sonic as an example. I love Sonic.
More about shape design later!</p>
<p>His cool attitude is exemplified not only through his design, but
through his pose. Getting inventive with the way the character stands or
sits, using that to squeeze the most personality into your design you
can is key! No more t-posing or facing the camera with hands by your
sides.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1633.png" alt="image" /> <img

<p>Have fun with it. How would your character sit, stand, wait, run? All
of this is part of the design of the character, not just the job of the
animator. When you think about iconic characters like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugs_Bunny&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864973307&amp;usg=AOvVaw23lMMgBfmzxC0PHymJLFer">Bugs

or <a

they all have poses that they call to your mind. An important thing to
note too is that they are all confident characters. However, the way
that this comes through in their posing is very unique to each - they
all hold themselves completely differently.</p>
<h4 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple</h4>
<p>So, a side effect of having no true idea of purpose or function to
your character, and of designing them simply to look appealing is
festooning your character in stuff that clutters up their design. Needs
more belts!</p>

<img src="./images/unnamed_019.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>Try to give any accessories your character has a reason for being
there. It could be environmental - maybe if they live in a harsh world,
they need to wear/equip some kind of day to day protection. Maybe it's
something that was given to them and has sentimental value. Maybe it's a
relic of their past. Maybe it demonstrates their personality. Whatever
it is, use it as a way to deepen the world or the character. If it
doesn't have a function, your character design might be better off
without it.</p>

<p>Using Midge from my comic <a
href="https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_Girl_and_the_Glim/uXsyEAAAQBAJ?hl%3Den%26gbpv%3D1%26pg%3DPT4%26printsec%3Dfrontcover&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864974881&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jnnUQaiiQCh7T4dlAHwkr">The
Girl and the Glim</a> as an example, I chose to give her two
accessories. One is a friendship bracelet, and one is her brother's old
hoodie. Midge is a character whose core conflict revolves around the
fear that people won't like her. The bracelet represents how valuable
friendship is to her as well as being an indication of her past, a
reminder that moving house means she has left her friends behind. The
hoodie is a familiar object that Midge uses to hide herself from others.
It helps me a lot when demonstrating her shyness and gives me lots of
nice posing options that are unique to her as a character.</p>

<h4 id="style-and-influences">Style and Influences</h4>
<p>The style you choose to design your characters in will vary depending
on the story you are designing them for. Your target audience will also
play a big role in these decisions! Setting Stranger Things in the 80's
had no functionality story-wise. The same story could easily have been
told with a modern day setting. However, the creators/designers knew
that the story was targeting the generation who grew up on The Goonies
and E.T., and wanted to evoke that nostalgia in their audience, and so
they chose to set the story within this time period to create the kind
of mood and atmosphere they felt would connect with their audience.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1138.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>Each of the styles here communicate something different about the
story's intent.</p>
<p>The Ghibli style character top left is unlikely to be involved in the
same kind of story as the screaming Arin Hanson caricature below her.
Likewise the far right Unicorn's world will be very different to the
bird girl's below.</p>
<p>Choosing a style that communicates is important, as establishing
audience expectation and then not living up to that promise can cause a
knee-jerk reaction from your viewers (though you can also deliberately
use it to create twists!). Just as important is being consistent with
this style.</p>
<p>A pet peeve I have is when a show or comic will have a lineup of
characters, 90% of which are consistent with one another, but then have
one design that will completely throw off the aesthetic of the show.</p>

Silent Voice</a> (2016)</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with designs being broad and having more
variety in lineups is something I am strongly in favor of. However, if
you're going to make zanier design choices, you need to sprinkle that
throughout your world, rather than having just one character following a
different ruleset.</p>
<p>In the above screenshot, Tomohiro the larger character has a head
that is disproportionately large and cartoonish compared to the rest of
the cast. I think it's great that they included a character with a
larger body type, but it feels like he is from a different movie. This
dissonance kept pulling me out of this fantastic movie, which is a
shame. I think they could have pulled his facial design more in line
with the rest of the cast to avoid this problem. Also - go and see A
Silent Voice if you get the chance, it's a wonderful film!</p>
<p>There are times when you might want to break this ruleset
deliberately - for example, if you are deliberately making the statement
that this character is not of this world, and doesn't belong. However in
general you should try to keep your style consistent in order to keep
your world feeling believable.</p>

<p>Design for Animation Needs:</p>
<p>A further consideration when designing characters is how they will
function with the chosen animation style. A character animated with the
puppet tool in After Effects will have very different animation needs to
one designed for traditional frame-by-frame animation in TV Paint or
Harmony.</p>
<p>Think about which character animation style will work for your chosen
aesthetic and carefully research what type of world your story is set
in. A cartoony, squash-and-stretch animation style may work great for a
quirky cast of characters.</p>

<p>The word ‘shape’ appears more than 90 times in this document, you

<p>There’s a wide spectrum between simple and complex, characters can
vary from <strong><em>realism</em></strong> to
<strong><em>caricature</em></strong> and excessive to minimalism -
inhabiting many degrees of diversification and stylization.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1130.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_484.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The character designs you create will influence how the animation
<strong>style of movement</strong> will develop.</p>
<p>This includes the characters’ flexibility, mobility, and type of hair
&amp; clothing.</p>
<p>There can be a predetermined set of rules and parameters in the style
of animation that may influence how you design the characters as well.
For example: you may be on a production that won’t be able to
accommodate for drapery and long flowing capes, cloaks and hair, for
either a 2D or 3D production, because these technical limitations could
be beyond the scope of the software (or budget), and this would restrict
you to creating more tight-fitting clothes and maybe LEGO-style
stiff/blocky hair.</p>
<p>Most of the time designers need to research and ask lots of questions
and perhaps even see the shooting-style of the storyboards in order to
ascertain what limitations there may be in the characters for their
restrictions in movements, clothing, hairstyles and range of expressive
attitudes. Sometimes there’s technical limitations with what the
characters can do; Perhaps they must have form-fitting clothes and short
hair because it would become too complex to animate long-flowing hair
and loose-baggy clothing.</p>

<p>Digging a bit deeper on the use of images and symbols to represent
ideas and how there’s a range within the spectrum of all art and
illustration when it pertains to realism, stylization, and visual
symbolism. Adding symbols, icons, or signs to your character design can
add another layer of depth and mystique. This could be giving your
character an object that is strongly associated with them, adding <a

<p>These symbols are used as metaphors - imagery that represents their

story's deeper meaning. They can help establish themes, character arcs,
and communicate important ideas. They can also help audiences relate to

<h4 id="design-for-technical-needs">Design for Technical Needs</h4>
<p>If the production is using cut-out/puppet-style animation, you’ll
need to design each part of your character with a mindset in how it will
connect and rotate with other body parts. <a

keeping the rig <a

<h4 id="knowing-the-limitations">Knowing the Limitations</h4>
<p>Being aware of the production’s parameters and any specific
restrictions involved is important knowledge to have and use in your
quest to determine the style. Oftentimes, because the design process can
start very early in the production pipeline, there are no clearly
defined lists of conditions to be conscious of. At some point, your
thought process should be mindful of any constraints in the artistic and
technical aspects for the characters’ anatomy and physical capabilities.
Budgetary concerns and even what software/technology is being used can
also be factors to consider.</p>

<p>For example - the series <a
href="https://youtu.be/D1CReMRbwAk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864989295&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jNamHew-yliVsBiVRQMBx">Pickle
&amp; Peanut</a> of the characters in Toonboom Harmony could be made
practical and functional for animators. The stories and circumstances
the characters would find themselves in required them to manipulate,
bend, deform, and contort their bodies to meet the needs of the
animation style.</p>
<p>A hybrid animation approach was taken for some aspects of the
animation (a combination of traditional animation with rigged
animation), since their faces and limbs were so flexible and unique in
their poses and expressiveness from scene to scene. Therefore a unique
production pipeline had to be made: Where the character rigs were
customized from scene to scene to meet the demands of the exaggerated
and dynamic posing the characters had to do. This way, the models the
artists would animate could perform the actions depicted in the
storyboards. Very rough storyboards were made and delivered to a team of
<em>character layout artists</em>, who would use those storyboards as
reference and hand-draw/clean-up and add details to the extensive
posing/acting of every shot, placing the characters on-model on as they
go. Then another team would take these drawn out character <a
href="https://youtu.be/bF8IYpThr_w&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597864990545&amp;usg=AOvVaw0r1p7xiMRZib1NLFcWXwAc">layouts</a>
and make customized rigs using the character builds and breaking them,
to make the poses match the artwork scene by scene. Then a team of
animators would animate the movements from pose to pose using these
custom rigs.</p>
<p>If you’re designing with no finished scripts in hand, you may only
have some rough ideas as to what sorts of stories these characters will
find themselves in, this is also common. Getting just a hint of what the
characters will need to perform in their scenes by analyzing scripts
from the episodic stories will help in the refinement of your designs.
Knowing if it’s a fast-paced action/adventure series is very different
from knowing it’s a slow-paced lots-of-talking style series. On feature
films the story is constantly evolving through to the very end of
production. You simply adapt with the changes from the very beginning as
things are developing right until the end of the main production phase
as you assist and change designs according to the needs of the
production.</p>
<p>The term <strong>function over form</strong> comes from the
architectural principle “form follows function,” which means that the
shape of the building should primarily relate to its intended function.
Make-up Design, Set Design and Costume Design all have the same
principle. In interior design, <em>function over form</em> means
prioritizing how you will use the room or piece of furniture over how it
looks. In character design, the same term can be identified when trying
to reach a balance between the artistic needs and requirements of your
design, versus its practical use for the purpose of the story being
told. “Form” is the look of your design, how good, and how cool, and how
appealing it looks. “Function” is how practical and usable it is for
animation production.</p>
<p>When developing the look and structure of your characters, you must
ask yourself: why are you creating this character, what environment are
they from or live in, what are the stories and scenarios they will
appear in, and who are you creating these characters for; the target
audience is something to consider when designing your characters.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Designing how characters will <strong>move</strong> can often be
overlooked. The manner in which they move and the mechanics of how they
move, how much stretch-ability and flexibility they may have, are all
factors to consider. Especially once the demands of the production kick
in. Getting to explore and design how movements communicate and enhance
character in any Pre <em>Production Test Animation</em> stages can often
spotlight some changes in your designs that need to be made. Never
forget: your work will be taken by many other artists and they will
animate your designs!</p>
<p><em>A famous story in animation:</em></p>
<p>Bill Melendez, the director of the 1965 TV Special “A Charlie Brown
Christmas”, had to explain to broadcast executives that the characters
in a <em>Peanuts</em> cartoon simply could not hold items ‘above their
heads’ - No matter how much the producers insisted upon it, this wasn’t
physically possible since their arms were so short and their heads were
so big. So <em>cheats</em> and creative solutions always had to be made
when staging the action.</p>

<p>Modern animated series like <em>Green Eggs &amp; Ham</em>,
<em>Animaniacs</em>, and <em>Central Park</em> are just some of many
that had traditional model sheets drafted for animators to use as
reference, there were NO rigs or Builds created at all for the
characters even though they were entirely digitally-produced. Classical
frame-by-frame animation methods were used to create every scene in
every episode, and it was animated using <em>Harmony</em> software. They
were made to look as if drawn traditionally on paper. Tablets and
Cintiqs were used to essentially animate in classical methods with
entirely digital paperless-animation tools, with very specific custom
brushes built for the clean-up animation process for the look of the
<em>final line</em>.</p>

<p>The more traditionally-animated the characters are, the more
beneficial it is to keep the characters simpler in design, this reduces
the amount of work for animators must do to make them move. The less
lines and textures to animate, the easier it will be to have the
characters perform complex actions and acting.</p>

<p>As a character designer you may be asked to create the full cast of
main characters for a story. You will eventually need to assemble your
designs into a model pack. At first you may only be assisting a lead
designer, but if you are in charge of multiple characters and to make an
ensemble cast out of them, a model pack is inevitable:</p>
<p><strong>The Model Pack</strong> refers to the character design sheets
for a cast of characters from an animated film or series. A Model Pack
attributes to just the characters. While a Main Design Pack (MDP)
usually refers to all main characters and key locations/props, that sets
the style and tone for the entire series or project.</p>

<p>In an animated series, Storyboard Artists must often create all sorts
of new incidental/secondary and alternative designs that go beyond the
initial design pack they were given to use as reference. Therefore,
after a storyboard/animatic is done and approved, a <em>post-board
design pass</em> is done; A new comprehensive list is made, artists then
complete all remaining on-screen design elements that will need to be
animated later on, this builds up and finalizes a more complete design
pack. Layout Artists and Build Artists/ Riggers use these new designs to
complete all remaining assets needed for the animators to have in their
scenes to animate with.</p>
<p>A consolidated design pack is made after the storyboards are done,
and before <a

<p>In the beginning, the designs you develop and sketch and create are
to find out what the characters would look like, and eventually they get

and locked in, and decisions are made as to which design is best suited
for the character.</p>
<p>Afterwards, these designs are made to be used as references for all
the artists that come <strong>after</strong> you, to use in production.
So keep in mind, the more visual information you can offer, the more
helpful it will be to the crew that will bring your characters to
life.</p>

src="./images/unnamed_1510.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>In some cases, animation tests are made, and the outcome of those
tests causes there to be revisions in the designs. Unforeseen
limitations or obstacles are discovered in the testing process, leading
to adjustments made to the designs and builds in order to make them more
functional for animation purposes.</p>

<p>If the story requires a character to perform an action that is
physically impossible for them to do, then changes to their design may
be needed in order for the performance to work, or ‘cheats’ are made in
the poses and builds to accommodate the action to happen.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-appeal">Thoughts on Appeal</h3>
<p>Spend enough time talking to animators and you’ll start to hear the
word ‘appeal’ come up. In terms of animated characters, appeal is what
makes an audience see the character as charismatic, relatable or
realistic. It’s what makes us feel for them, and remember them, even
after the animation is over.</p>
<p>Advice from <a
href="https://www.deanheezen.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865001681&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ISUz8hNFDeqkpky3KQVjF">Dean

src="./images/unnamed_574.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_502.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>It’s imperative to keep in mind the purpose of these characters and
their stories, what is the intended audience of the animated work you
are designing for, and how your character design will fit within the
context of the production.</p>
<p>From simplistic, with a wide range of exaggeration:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1018.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And simplistic, with a more limited range of expressions and
exaggerations:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_884.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To more complex in details, with a wide range of exaggeration:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1629.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1347.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>And complex, with a limited range of exaggeration, with more
realistic mechanics of movement:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_076.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_144.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Design sheets can offer a wide range of information for several
departments in the production.</p>
<p>The art direction, your client’s needs, and the requirements of the
production will dictate how simplified your character style needs to be.
You may want a more artistic look to help your characters stand out from
the crowd - this may call for more of a ‘broad’ character design, or a
stylized, abstract, or angular look, maybe a combination of realism and
strong graphic qualities.</p>

<p>When presenting a cast of characters, it’s often a good idea to show
the dynamics of the group.</p>

<p><strong>Tilt</strong>, <strong>Rhythm</strong>, &amp;
<strong>Twist</strong> - Here’s tips to use when posing. Former Disney
animator Glen Keane coined tilt, rhythm, and twist; if you have a
background in studio art or art history, you’ll be familiar with the
term Contrapposto (“Counter Pose”) Tilt and Twist are easy enough to
explain: you can get tilt/twist in the head, shoulders, and hips, this
will help the pose feel less rigid–you’re essentially applying
overlapping action to the pose, causing counter-weights or contrast in
the postures.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1255.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rhythm is a slightly more complex concept. Rhythm is about the flow
of your lines and how they lead the eye around the drawing. It’s hard to
describe in words, hopefully this graphic helps:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1306.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Simple vs. Complex</strong> - Rhythm is also tied into the
concept of simple vs. complex. You see simple vs. complex in the
elements that make up a character, but also in the pose as a whole, and
the textures within the character design and scene composition. These
contrasts within the pose itself helps to create appeal.</p>

<p>Part of achieving <strong>Appeal</strong> in character design is to

<p>Avoiding Tangents in designs and posing is another factor that helps
with appeal:</p>

<p>Creating appeal in your designs can be the most challenging aspect of
the work. There’s thousands of variables that all play off of each
other. Only with time, countless hours of study &amp; keen observations,
with lots and lots of practice, can you build up your instincts to know
how to recognize appealing designs and how to create them.</p>

structure, figure out what makes it work, break things down, create

<p>Design sheets are often made showing breakdowns and constructions to
figure out the mechanics and movements of your character and their range
of motion for animators to have as reference, but these are also made to
maintain some rules for the solidity and structure of your characters
and useful strategies on how to pose them.</p>

the fundamentals</a> of human (and animal) anatomy. This will give you
knowledge on how to simplify and stylize them to accommodate the
specific anatomy for the characters you’re creating. By doing so, you’ll
learn how to customize the anatomy for your own characters, to make it
fit in the style that is intended.</p>

has their own unique construction:</p>

<p>Drawing quick gestures is a great method of practice as it is a
significant exercise that can help you fully grasp how to draw a
body.</p>
<p>The practice of gesture drawing involves making a quick and
simplified sketch of your subject matter (typically a human body).</p>
<p>When <a
href="https://youtu.be/jiD_lfggwFQ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865024727&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Y-0NL8GnP3zfeHQk4k45L">gesture
drawing</a>, you are trying to plot down the main elements of the figure
in quick and simple linework to capture the general feel of the body and
the pose you are trying to communicate.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_505.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is very helpful in allowing you to get a feel for the flow of
the body and how to visually communicate body language, gestures, and
poses, in a very simplified manner.</p>
<p>To do gesture drawing, all you really need is a pen and paper, or
maybe a drawing tablet or an Apple Pencil and iPad, and some sort of
reference.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_528.png" alt="image" /> <img

src="./images/unnamed_606.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_073.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>This can simply be an online reference image, or if you wanted to try
gesture drawing the traditional way, you could use a live model — maybe
even try to find a class to attend.</p>
<p>Then, all that’s left to do is start <a

the body as simply and quickly as you can, ignore specific details, and
instead try to draw the flow and linework of the body.</p>

<p>Remember to give yourself a time limit, ranging from 30 minutes to
under 30 seconds.</p>
<p>As well as this, don’t use an eraser! Just let your pencil flow as
you try to capture the essence of the body.</p>
<p>This time limit and lack of eraser will force you to really try and
quickly plot down the main elements of the human form, making you more
easily grasp any important details and therefore providing you with a
better understanding of how to draw a body.</p>

<h4 id="human-anatomy">Human Anatomy</h4>
<p>Every character you create will have their own unique style of
anatomy, the key is to stay consistent within your own style, you will
have different body types and body shapes for different characters, but
as you create a cast of characters in the world/style you are creating.
The more you’ll see the range of proportions you will need to do, the
more you’ll refine the anatomy to match that character’s physique and
personality.</p>

to help you improve.</p>
<p>When you’re doing more human anatomy based in realism, there are
different factors to consider, compared to when you do more

<p>Before you can begin adding personality and stylization to the bodies
you draw, it is integral to understand the proportions of human anatomy.
Getting the body proportionally correct can be difficult, but there are
a few shape-work techniques you can use to sketch the human body as
shown in the samples above and below. Practice drawing your <a

aspects of design; you need it for any character you might want to
create or even in environmental artworks with people in the
background.</p>
<p>So studying and practicing how to draw a body is important. You want
to feel comfortable creating stylized figures in whatever poses and
designs you would like.</p>

<p>How to breakdown and learn from the references you save &amp;

<p><strong>So let's make Bad Art of a Deer because I happen to have one

<p>Start with a photo of your subject in a nice/neutral pose with all
four feet visible (so not like me).</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1132.png" alt="image" />

<p>Freehand copy it. Try not to stylize, focusing instead of matching
proportions and pose. Don't get too detailed!</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Either <em>lasso + distort</em> or redraw a copy of your first sketch
with your reference behind it (scaled to match the main body of your
sketch).</p>
<p>Put the original and modified sketches together and compare the
differences. Write it down if you want. This shows you where your eyes
saw things the wrong size, so you can correct for that next time.</p>

<p>It's ok if your art looks terrible and has broken legs. I've drawn
LOTS of deer so I have a leg up. Everyone's art sucks in their own eyes
and here's where mine went wrong: <a

again.</p>

<p>You can stop here and move on to your real drawing, Or do another
freehand-fix-compare cycle. I actually overcorrected my "draws heads too
big" and veered into "heads too small."</p>

<p>Another note on tracing: Learning HOW to trace is more important than
anything you could learn by tracing. Draw the Anatomy, not the outline.
In real life, things don't have outlines, they have bones.</p>

<p>These are from the same shoot which is extra useful for consistency.
The lines are minimal and follow where the animal's joints are, and only
important parts are drawn.</p>
<p>You won't know what Important Parts means right off the bat, which is
where in-depth study comes in. You need to do this over and over, to
learn the hard parts, to do the easy parts right.</p>

<p>We'll start with bones. Search up "[animal] skeleton" and get photos
or super scientific illustrations. Add in things like "top view" to
spice it up.</p>
<p>Next, search "[animal] skeleton sketchfab." This pulls up 3D models
that you can rotate in your browser. Remember that these are art and the
anatomy is only as good as the artist, so pick a good one.</p>

<p>Time for bone!</p>
<p>The spine is the most important, and in a lot of animals it will
surprise you. Draw it in over your photo and then add spikes because
skeletons are punk. These are not scientific and I didn't count them
because their number doesn't matter to art. So you better be referencing
scientists and not me!</p>

<p>The rest of the bones and some notes. These are my notes to
<em>myself</em> about things I want to remember. My personal discoveries
in anatomy that made my art better. You can make the same notes but also
make sure you have your own thoughts on there as well. That's how you
help yourself the best. Be as detailed or vague as you want.</p>

<p>Same deal with muscle. Here are my personal notes to myself. Label
stuff that is important to you. I actually grouped a bunch of muscles
together based on what is visible from the outside. Muscles are way more
complicated than this, but Baby's First Anatomy Chart gets to be
simple.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1158.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is good enough for me because I have intimate knowledge of the
other muscles working under and over these ones. Feel free to add as
many or as few muscles as you like. You chart your own course.</p>
<p>This is very VERY much not an anatomical chart. I'm sure there's
nerds out there pulling their hair out looking at this. But listen, it
works for art!</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And you know the wildest part about this?</p>
<p>I don't need to look at it to use it. The act of making your own
anatomy chart puts that knowledge in your brain. Like how you can make
"cheat sheets" even for tests that don't allow them - the act of making
the sheet helps you remember what you struggle with most.</p>
<p>And after all that complexity? Your simplification will be based on
Real Knowledge and you'll put those random circles in the right
spots.</p>

levels will advance VERY quickly the more you do these types of
breakdowns and analysis.</p>

<h3 id="stylization">Stylization</h3>
<p>This can be a very subjective thing to define. How much ‘style’
should you put into your design? What is ‘style’? And where do you start
on this broad spectrum?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Often your limitations dictate a lot of your stylistic and
creative choices, and I think that’s OK, as long as you have an
interesting concept to work from.” - Drew Daniels,
Cinematographer</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This involves you finding your specific and individual style of
drawing, and sticking to it consistently throughout your artwork. In a
broader sense, the stylization process and the stylizing of character
designs can encompass the countless ways of creating art, and everyone
will find their own style through practice. It's all about how to make
these drawings and designs feel like your own, and for each new
production and concept you dive into, you find the style that best
serves the character personalities, and the world and scenarios they
will find themselves in.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_540.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_386.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>How much style is too much style? Everyone has their own preference
and opinion, and many factors are involved in the defining of
<strong>style</strong>, and how far to push the stylization of something
and how much detail to add or subtract. Many decisions are made on how
much exaggeration should be injected or removed from the designs.</p>
<p>Here are designs by Ana Piedrafita for the Pocoyo series:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_022.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_642.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_603.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_822.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1178.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Simplicity and cuteness is obviously the goal for these designs.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_023.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, ascetic minimalism itself holds little meaning. Context
imbues significance. The process of simplifying designs and the art of
reducing the amount of details often expresses more with less.
Restrictions hone communication to indispensable signals, the easier and
faster a designer is recognized, the more successful your character
model will be. At the intersection of restraint and intent, very simple
designs with basic shapes and forms uplifts truth and beauty: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Pn4oOD__tmE?t%3D23%26feature%3Dshare&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865112213&amp;usg=AOvVaw3W-Rq-heZqQv7fD0w8-QFU">Keep
it Simple</a></p>
<p>Examples of Bold Exaggerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Johnny Bravo</strong> – Crazy hairdo, bulging pecs, and
arrogance exaggerated for laughs</li>
<li><strong>Adventure Time</strong> – Friends frolicking through surreal
candy-filled worlds</li>
<li><strong>Samurai Jack</strong> – Jagged lightning style pushed into
epic presentation</li>
<li><strong>Borderlands</strong> – Dark humor and visual edge match its
absurdity</li>

<p>Pioneers of low-poly / pixel art / 8-bit styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minecraft</strong> – LEGO-like blocks empower creative
construction</li>
<li><strong>Re-Volt</strong> – Toy RC cars gain tactile charm</li>
<li><strong>Voxatron</strong> – Voxel retro effects evoke gaming’s
dawn</li>
<li><strong>Habbo Hotel</strong> – Minimized avatars enable diverse
expression</li>
<li><strong>Thomas Was Alone</strong> – Geometric shapes brimming with
personality</li>
<li><strong>Super Mario / Megaman / Link from Legend of Zelda</strong> –
Nintendo mascots</li>
</ul>

src="./images/unnamed_581.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1341.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_904.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Simple geometric models tap a nostalgia vein through their blocky
charm. Low poly art employs hard edges and elemental shapes rather than
pursuing endless detail. Less complexity focuses attention on
possibilities over realities.</p>
<p>Abstract shapes leave space for imagination to fill the gaps. Our
minds complete the visions through personalized perceptions. Low poly
models guide eyes through implied motions along crisp vector paths. By
finding virtue in technological limits and distortion, low poly art
spotlights stirring essence below surface elaboration.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_913.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All styles contain strengths to amplify their personalities and
stories. Photorealism conveys humanity, cartooning enables humor, and
low poly maximizes minimalism. Wise character creators mix and match
sensibly by considering impacts on emotion, branding, and performance.
Most importantly, they pour passion into every line and pixel. That
personal touch makes all the difference.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1439.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_781.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Highly stylized art similarly cranks up reality through visual
hyperbole. Every element gets exaggerated just shy of breaking
believability, amplifying the stories they’re into operatic spectacles.
Super-exaggerated anatomy heightens the humor. By escaping the shackles
of realism, artists can bend the medium to meet the vision. Costumes
morph into über-symbolic power fantasies. Weapons swell to outrageous
proportions mirroring their warrior’s outsized strength. Highly
distorted bodies become human ideograms. Backdrops warp surreally to
externalize psychological subtexts. Realism depicts what is; stylization
reveals what could be.</p>
<p>But the most effective exaggeration remains anchored to humanity. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OHiMWRlGoMs?feature%3Dshare&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865115774&amp;usg=AOvVaw0smzCncERAO3fIKjJ6P3ur">Caricatures</a>
work best when we perceive the real person peering through the
warped/simplified/exaggerated version you see. Unique character art
style choices should align with and amplify authentic traits rather than
pile on arbitrarily. Like a bungee cord, the most elastic visions snap
back to their origins.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1699.png" alt="image" /> <img

src="./images/unnamed_280.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_732.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Preferences in stylization and appeal can be a subjective topic of
discussion, it’s all about how much to simplify, or not simplify, how
representative to real-life people, animals, and objects it needs to be,
and how far can the exaggeration be pushed.</p>

<p>A term you might hear a director or client say: “<em>Push the
style</em>”.</p>
<p>It may seem like an arbitrary statement, but it’s usually referring
to revising/improving the design in a way that further exaggerates the
aspects and elements that give the artwork its unique appearance. If the
eyes are proportionally quite big, make them bigger. If the hands are
small, make them smaller. If the character is quite square and blocky,
make them more so. If the characters seem very flat and rigid, make them
more so. If they are very squashy and gooey, then make them more so. If
the characters have long skinny limbs, make them more so.</p>

<p>Pushing styles is about finding out how far is too far - if the eyes
are small, make them extra small. If they have big hair, make them extra
big. If they have long skinny limbs, snake them extra long. If they have
tiny hands, make them extra tiny. If they have thick feet, make them
extra thick.</p>
<p>Pushing style levels is always fun, as you can see from these
examples, shapes and proportions and scale are the main factors that can
have anyone experiment with how to stylize your designs more or less,
it’s boundless the range you can explore.</p>

<p>Discovering what the limitations are within the particular designs
you are creating is part of the process. Developing the structure,
design logic, and anatomy of your character’s style can be a journey in
itself:</p>

<p>There can be a vast spectrum to consider when finding the style
you’re looking for. Most times, people don’t know what style they want
to see, or create, until they’ve seen it. But usually offering a range
of realistic to cartoony, covers a spectrum of possibilities to begin
narrowing down the <strong>style</strong> a client (or you) may be
looking for.</p>

<p>One method you can use to find your style is to test out different
ways of drawing a body until you find something that works for you,
adapting it until it becomes your own. For methods and inspiration for
drawing stylized anatomy specifically, see <a

<p>Experiment with linework; try different sketching styles, like using
harsh confident linework or smooth-flowing lines.</p>
<p>Because styles are so limitless, there are so many methods you can
use to learn how to stylize your body.</p>

<p>Staying consistent within your own style can take a long time to
figure out and accomplish, the secret to fostering and developing this
with yourself is through lots and lots and lots of drawing, it’s the
only way to discover how YOU can draw your own thing, in your own way,
and explore and fine-tune how YOU would handle any type of character.

<p>For studios in particular - it’s referred to as ‘<em>the house
style</em>’ when a specific studio has a very particular and consistent
look to all their designs for all their productions. <em>Old
Disney</em>, compared to <em>Modern Disney</em>, same as <em>Klasky
Csupo</em>, <em>Pixar</em>, <em>Don Bluth</em>, <em>Filmation</em>,
<em>Nelvana</em>, <em>Aardman</em> or <em>Ghibli</em>, they all have
their own distinct, consistent, and long-running visual styles
(especially in their early years) that they are most known for. Other
more modern animation companies like <em>Studio Cachette</em>, <em>The
Line</em>, <em>Madhouse</em>, <em>Laika</em>, and <em>Screen
Novelties</em> all have fairly unique and distinct house styles seen in
most of their work. Though the art direction may vary from production to
production, they seem to have a signature “look” to all the shows and
films they’ve made.</p>

<p>There’s over 100 years of character design history to become familiar
with. Every few years we see trends change, tastes change, and new
talent gets injected into the industry with new and fresh ideas. Often
old styles tend to resurface and get re-imagined, and as new designers
discover and rediscover old art styles, they often get remixed into the
new modern styles we see today.</p>

<p>For example, looking back at the designs from the
<strong>80s</strong> and <strong>90s</strong>, the characters are more
realistic and in a way, have many similar looks and traits, comparable
to the comic books of that era. But going into the
<strong>2000s</strong> and <strong>2010s</strong>, many shows began to
have a wider range of shapes and silhouettes for character design
styles, borrowing aspects from the <strong>50s</strong> and
<strong>60s</strong>:</p>

again.</p>

<p>A <strong>stylized character</strong>, in general, is a character
that has its proportions deformed and exaggerated in some ways to create
a magnified character - made out to have a softer/cuter look, or just a
super-simplified version of what would be a realistic character as well.
Other ways to “push the style” is to overemphasize certain physical
attributes, if the character is blocky and angular - make them more so,
if the character is bubbly and cute make them more so. There are many
ways to approach how you want your character to look.</p>

<p>You can try creating a Chibi version (a term derived from Japan), or
a stylized character similar to those seen in contemporary animated
movies.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1370.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main distinction between them lies in the level of deformation
these characters undergo. Chibis, originating from already stylized
characters in manga or anime, exhibit significant deformations.</p>
<p>Currently, these types of characters find use in several
applications, primarily in animated series or video games. Their
visually appealing aesthetics easily capture the attention of younger
audiences, but their charming appearance also attracts adults.</p>

<p>However, there are numerous ways to create highly-stylized
characters, making them one of the most challenging aspects to achieve,
in both 2D and 3D/CGI. They can also be used ironically for a <a

or humorous effect.</p>
<p>​​<img src="./images/unnamed_1044.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>When it comes to proportions, stylized characters share common
characteristics - the process can be divided into three parts: head,
body, face. Depending on the proportions you choose, you can achieve a
more realistic impression similar to Fortnite or a more cartoonish
character.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head:</strong> the bigger the better. The head, along with
the face, is the most crucial aspect of these models. Not only do you
need to enlarge the head, but you should also make it rounder to give
the character a softer appearance. If there are special features on the
head that are characteristic of the character, such as scars or
wrinkles, include them, but exaggerate their appearance.</li>
<li><strong>Face:</strong> the face, together with the head, is one of
the most important parts. The face should be proportionate with the
head, so maintain balance in their proportions. Pay special attention to
the eyes, making them rounder and larger than the other facial features.
Even if you are aiming for a more realistic proportions, consider
enlarging the eyes slightly to enhance expressiveness.
<ul>
<li><figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_622.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> in contrast to the head, the body tends to
lose its shape and become smaller, often as small as two and a half
heads. Additionally, the body tends to lose its landmarks on the
muscles. To create the desired shape, you will need to exaggerate the
basic forms of the body. For instance, you can use a triangular shape to
emphasize a muscular body or a rectangular shape to create an slender
body.</li>
</ul>

cartoony’ character:</p>

<p>As a general rule; try to use a small color palette, ideally with no
more than five main colors. This will help you focus on your artistic
goals.</p>
<p>Mastering stylized art requires a thoughtful blend of proportion and
a limited yet impactful color scheme for charming character design. With
these small tips, hopefully, you can start designing your own
characters.</p>

<p>Don’t forget, every artist has their own journey, and every character
you create is a step on your path of artistic discovery and growth.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-art-direction">What is Art Direction?</h3>
<p>It is the LOOK of your production. Design, Color, Lighting, Shapes,
Textures - many elements are involved. Art direction can be a broad term
depending on which industry and what types of productions you’re
referring to, but this usually pertains to the design
<strong>style</strong> of the <a
href="https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-7/art-of-zootopia-part-2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865138655&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qFhETorYEjrDe4-46fpg7">backgrounds</a>
(locations / sets / environments / scenery) for an animated production.
However, in a broader sense, it also includes the <a
href="https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-7/art-of-zootopia-part-1&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865138849&amp;usg=AOvVaw3dMNg45FZ4ST2VHe_MqQj_">character</a>
art style as well, which also consists of clothing, props &amp; FX, and
how well they all work together - for the overall look and visual
aesthetics of the entire production. As a result, lots of research and
development is made to find the right look.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1097.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1166.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>These are important factors to know since character design does
affect other aspects of the design process on a production. Usually many
levels of communication between various artists is needed for creating
all aspects of the characters, props, and backgrounds. Keeping
everything consistent while meeting the production’s demands can be
challenging. Be aware that as a character designer, you may have a
<em>Design Supervisor</em> or <em>Character Supervisor</em> or <em>Art
Director</em> as your manager/department lead.</p>

<p>The title of <strong>Art Director</strong> and <strong>Production
Designer</strong> are often interchangeable. Sometimes they can be a
solitary artist working on concept designs and visual development alone,
or they can be the lead on a team of designers and held responsible for
keeping consistency and cohesiveness through the many departments and
stages of the design process.</p>
<p>The duties may vary from production to production and studio to
studio, but Art Directors are usually responsible for all aspects of the
visual style of the animated film or series. On big productions, there
can be an art director for each department - bringing to life the
production designer’s vision and style. They decide how the characters,
props and environments are going to look and provide a basis for the
rest of the design department to work from.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Art Directors on a 3DCG animated film</strong></li>
<li><strong>Overall Vision:</strong> The Art Director sets the overall
style and aesthetic of the film, ensuring it aligns with the director's
vision and story.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> They work closely with the director,
production designer, and other artists to guide the creative
process.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Leadership:</strong> They provide direction,
feedback, and guidance to the art team, ensuring the film's visual
elements are cohesive and impactful.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can have cartoony-looking characters within
hyper-realistic environments like <a

<p>In animated feature films - Art directors can also be known as CG
Supervisors, VFX Supervisors, and Production Designers.</p>
<p>Concept art is the earliest exploration for finding the look of the
production and to create visual ideas for everyone to see and comment on
and this work is often used as part of a pitch to sell the project, film
or series, before production is fully underway. The work of an art
director is more specific and directive than the work of a concept
artist or visual development artist.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_901.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_322.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_601.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Concept artists are usually freelancers, they come in, bang out a few
sketches or color concepts and out they go, and they are the first to
draw the exploration sketches for the production. Sometimes when a
concept artist’s work becomes the style that the production is targeting
to be what they are going for (whether it be for environments or
characters) then they stick around for longer. Since their art is the
template that all other designs will be based off of. Usually a few
different concept artists are brought in, so they can do a scatter shot
of possible visual styles for the creative leads to use as reference.
This way they can see which artistic direction they would rather go
with. Their artwork is then used as a “look target” for background and
character designers further down the line.</p>
<p>In these very early stages, they produce artwork and collaborate with
the studio and directors to find a visual style that works. It’s
important that they communicate well with the client (creator/producer)
to understand what is needed. They will often have to go back and redo
their designs several times before they find something the studio/client
is happy with. Sometimes the first passes are quick and loose for faster
results and feedback. Other times, they add more detail and quality.
They use computer software as well as hand-drawing and painting to
create their art.</p>
<p>Sometimes <em>concept boards</em> or reference boards are made, where
lots of images are gathered as an initial inspiration pack by the visual
development artist to see if they’re going in the proper direction.
Before committing to sketches, these style boards can cover color
palettes, costuming, and hairstyles of all sorts. They can also be made
by the art director or creative producers to give to the concept artists
and designers, to guide them in the general direction they need to
go.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_487.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_140.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_186.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_639.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>These can also be called mood boards, image boards or aesthetic
boards; when it’s a big job, they are the best place to start before you
begin working on your characters/story. It’ll be where you lay out the
inspiration for your character as a whole, from their personality and
traits to what they wear and how they look. Think of it like a collage
of ideas for who your character is. It’s a chance for you to brainstorm
and gather your thoughts before diving into the writing or drawing part
of your project.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_467.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1517.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Art directors determine the ‘<em>design language</em>’ of the film,
which requires them to have an understanding of what the final,
on-screen image will look like and how to get there. They work with the
concept artists to develop sketches and artwork that communicate the
artistic vision to the rest of the crew. In big-budget feature films,
the Production Designer tends to be the one to give the consistent and
singular LOOK for the visual style of the world, and the team of Art
Directors supervise the many departments at every stage, to execute that
vision into realization.</p>

<p>Associated with Art Direction is the process of <a

Development</a> - it’s the stage in most 3D/CG animated productions that
builds the world and characters by creating the colors, textures, and
materials for everything you see in the final rendered images. Look
Development also explores how to actually achieve the intended visual
look, pursuing the technical side of taking the concept art and
discovering the process needed to practically attain and achieve the
<strong>look</strong> for the actual production.</p>
<p>In many 3D/CG feature films, Art Directors are involved throughout
the entire project, up to its release, acting as a supervisor to the
other artists, such as modelers, character designers and environment
designers. This is a job that involves a lot of communication with
people and needs strong management skills. They are responsible for
ensuring all artwork is of a high quality and in keeping with the
director’s vision. They are also responsible for making sure everyone in
the art department stays on budget and on schedule. Art directors are
sometimes employed as freelancers working on a project by project basis.
Art Direction usually splits into two main categories -
<strong>Environments</strong> (also known as: Sets / Backgrounds /
Locations) and <strong>Characters</strong>.</p>

<p>For animated feature films, hundreds upon hundreds of sketches &amp;
color concepts are drawn and painted in order to explore and later
refine the final look of the characters and settings found in the
movie.</p>
<p>In a 2D animated series - Character Design is a portion of the
<strong><em>Production Design</em></strong> phase of animation (which
can also include Environment &amp; Background Design, FX Design and Prop
Design), which is all part of the
<strong><em>Pre-Production</em></strong> process, where scripts, voices,
visual development, and story art are also produced.</p>

<h3 id="prop-design">Prop Design</h3>
<p>A quick note about prop designs - Most of the time prop designs are
made by a separate artist from the design department, there are times
where a character designer may be asked to help design props as well.
Items like any hand-held objects or vehicles and any item the characters
interact with, that are separate from the background or environment are
known as ‘props’. It’s important to cover prop design here since they
are unavoidably linked to character design.</p>

<p>It’s common to extract elements from background designs and construct
these as their own self-contained item with turnaround views as well,
depending on the art director, sometimes props are designed out of the
background concepts and sometimes background artists borrow from the
prop designs first to incorporate the item in the scenery. Sometimes
both background designs and prop designs use the storyboards for
reference, other times the designs need to be worked out in detail
first, so that the storyboard artists use them as reference and then it
gets carried through to final design in the animation scene setup
process.</p>

<p>Just like characters, prop designs are created in a certain visual
style, usually matching the graphic art style of the
backgrounds/environments. Sometimes they match more closely to the
character art style, especially if the backgrounds are very different
from the characters’ aesthetics. But they are objects needing to be
designed at various angles since they are meant to be animated. For
example, <a
href="https://people.com/thmb/OuqC8cHTbN8OTu7c-ThAiPDn0Hk%3D/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x449:901x451)/lilo-and-stich-42716eea64ad4d16a01c76f8c1ec30c3.jpg&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865156848&amp;usg=AOvVaw22DPffkITsT78w84zLBOb2">Lilo
&amp; Stitch</a> has watercolor-style painted backgrounds, so the prop
designs needed to look like they could easily fit within the
environments, but still match the characters’ overall art style, for
when they’re interacting with them. Sometimes the props would be
watercolor-style, sometimes they would be cel-painted with flat colors
when needing to be animated.</p>
<p>👉 Shape language, perspective &amp; structure plays a major part in
constructing prop models:</p>

them into final designs:</p>

<p>Grouping thumbnail roughs together to see how they will work when
they’re all in one location is common exercise too:</p>

lot:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1611.png" alt="image" /> <img

<p>Size comparisons are usually needed by having a faded version of the
main character on display for size relationship, especially for props
and items that are being handled and used by characters:</p>

<p>Prop designs follow the same visual language as any character and
background design:</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Props can also be attached to backgrounds, a common example are
doors, they are first designed by background artists, but then handled
as prop designs once they need to be animated to rotate and be shown at
many angles, and being handled by the characters as well. A car parked
in the background will only need to be designed from that one angle, but
once a character steps inside and begins to drive it around, it will
need to be properly designed and built with many angles and views, both
the interior and exterior.</p>
<p>Entire buildings can be considered as props, whether or not they are
animated (2D or 3D), even if they are levitating around by magic, and
not turning or rotating, they still become an object needing to be moved
around, therefore they become props.</p>

characters, you start off as roughs, then clean lines, then color.</p>

<p>There can be some visual symbolism and
<strong>personification</strong> involved in prop design:</p>
<p>This is the attribution of a personal nature or human characteristics
to something <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv%3D4b723428e1eceb0a%26sca_upv%3D1%26rlz%3D1C5CHFA_enCA1088CA1088%26sxsrf%3DACQVn0_Zhguo-Svwbh0MNZ9haDPic9l2Pw:1712840613513%26q%3Dnonhuman%26si%3DAKbGX_qNq0Y8zql7SxzZAf2-HTTOIEtv5zN5vFqBO9X-odMB9xL9-f50mcow_Q8Hi0wAIrvBmipYLhtnX5haguw_7l8Lk2hZkispn_SwbQk6ABbal2IMPm8%253D%26expnd%3D1%26sa%3DX%26sqi%3D2%26ved%3D2ahUKEwj53MzCnLqFAxW8EFkFHcXTDTIQyecJegQIHxAO&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865162313&amp;usg=AOvVaw0c2ZyniymKztvV3M5J38f3">nonhuman</a>,
or the representation of an abstract quality in human form. Like a tree
designed with its branches resembling long arms reaching out, or simply
adding a tiny face or an eye on a prop design, all these can add a
quality of personality to the object. Examples found in creative
writing: “The sun smiled down on us.”</p>
<p>“The story jumped off the page.”</p>
<p>“The light danced on the surface of the water.”</p>
<p>Examples of this could be: a backpack being designed to look old,
saggy, weathered and beaten up, to match the state-of-mind of its owner,
or to show what hardships this backpack has undergone. A mirror designed
to look monstrous and evil because it holds a magical creature inside.
You can always subvert expectations by having a sweet, cute,
innocent-looking object actually be used by someone dark and sinister
for a certain effect. Imagine what an enchanted key would look like if
it was designed to be linked to an all-seeing entity.</p>

<p>In novel writing and scriptwriting, personifying an object means to
figuratively describe it with human traits in order to craft a vivid
image of that object in your reader’s mind. But to interpret it in
illustration and animation would be to visually depict it so that it is
instantly recognizable; to subconsciously have the viewer identify it
with a personality type or behavior. The simple act of making a prop
look old, worn out and drooping, versus making it look fresh, young,
new, clean, perky and firm - can drastically change the feeling of how
the design will be perceived and what history may lie in that prop’s
narrative and purpose.</p>

<p>Principles of appeal, structure, and contrasting shapes also apply to
prop design, even the most simple objects:</p>

example, something as simple as <em>old fashion forks</em>, could have
you researching the <a

of silverware</a> to help in your inspiration.</p>
<p>There are sites like <a
href="https://hum3d.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865165552&amp;usg=AOvVaw24Zw5iJABAjIZnbOAs_bYs">hum3d.com</a>
that are great for searching up and observing hundreds of objects,
props, vehicles and anything else of this nature at various angles, for
drawing reference.</p>
<p>Gathering photo references to help in the design process is important
to the exploration and discovery part of your early concept art and
rough sketching. For example, let’s say you need to design an item for
an <em>alchemist’s portable toolbag</em>. Items to search up would be a
portable tackle box or tool bag (adding old or vintage in your search) -
begin sketching with a wide range of research images and see what items
you can combine together:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_373.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_815.jpg" alt="image" /> <img

src="./images/unnamed_559.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_191.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Sometimes props can become very complex, as a single item may need to
be illustrated from many different views and angles, and may have to be
opened up to reveal its interior. Vehicles are often the case, as scenes
can take place inside the vehicle as its own location, with plenty of
moving parts, and lots of items needing to be handled and interacted
with.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1189.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Oftentimes props can be very detailed and need lots of guides and
instructions on how they work, along with versions made for close-ups
and for far shots so that detailed versions can be reserved for
up-close/insert shots.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_169.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_526.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Notice how a red line is commonly used to indicate to the color
stylist that those lines should be self-colored or for that linework is
meant to be removed once the shapes are painted:</p>

<p>In a typical 2D animated series, there’s frequently more props to be
designed than they are characters. Sometimes props and character designs
cross paths, like when a character removes an article of clothing from
their body, then it becomes this independent item that comes off the
character and is now technically a ‘prop’, since it’s now an item
another character could grab and pick up and interact with, and maybe
dropped on the ground, then becoming part of the scenery.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1284.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1556.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Sometimes, as part of the character design, the model sheets need to
have props included, like a samurai warrior with their katana, or a
wizard that’s always holding their magic staff, a character always
wearing their backpack, or a butcher always carrying a cleaver with
them. Usually it’s items that are inherently linked to the character at
all times, making it part of their character design by default. These
are accessories that the character always has with them, therefore
become a part of that character’s design.</p>

<p>When it comes to prop design, an element of selective exaggeration
and caricaturing is often implemented as well, just like you would for
any character stylization/simplification - it all depends on the needs
and the <strong>look</strong> of the production. Often the environments,
props, and vehicle designs must be shaped and constructed in very
particular ways to make them appear like they belong and match the world
they’re in, alongside the characters they’ll be used with. They can
evoke lots of life and personality in their appearance, but they are
usually built to be <strong>appealing</strong> and
<strong>functional</strong>. As an example, let’s look at one particular
aspect of prop designs; focusing specifically in the area of vehicles in
the “choro-Q” style:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When designing vehicles for an animated production, it’s always
good to clearly display the characters’ faces. Many shows have the
characters with larger proportioned heads, so the windshields should be
adjusted accordingly. Toriyama knew this, and a lot of his manga work
featured appropriately-designed vehicles, but cartooned in a style that
works well for showcasing the characters. This chibi-style of vehicles
became a Japanese toy fad in the early 80s named choro-Q, and they were
known in North America as penny racers.” -Murray Bain, Art
Director</em></p>

<p>Keep in mind that the props your characters handle and the vehicles
they operate are essentially acting as supporting characters. They need
to be practical for the needs of the production and what is happening in
the story. How the characters USE the props must be kept in mind when
constructing their shapes, forms and proportions.</p>
<p>Vehicle concept designs from ParaNorman were well caricatured and
still made functional to accommodate the characters that would be using
them:</p>

<p>For whatever props you may be designing, experimenting how to
exaggerate and simplify is part of the design exploration process, as
with everything else, <strong>research</strong> is crucial. For example,
drawing vehicles can be one of the most challenging aspects of prop
design. Just like for character design, vehicle designs need to be
researched and collected for you to be inspired from.</p>

<p>Caricaturing architecture in a similar way is very common too:</p>

<p>Notice how interior design and furniture as well as exterior
architecture and be “caricatured” to give buildings a sense of
personality and distinctiveness as well:</p>

<p>All animated productions have rules and guidelines like this,
sometimes they are outlined in large volume and detail, many times they
are barely documented officially at all, for reasons like lack of time
to do so, and usually these style guides and directives are not
solidified until late into the production.</p>
<p>The spectrum of Realism vs Caricature is present in all aspects of
design stylization, including Backgrounds and FX designs as well. Some
productions can barely have any FX design in them due to the nature of
the stories, they don’t require too many animated elements like, water,
smoke, fumes, fire, splashes, ripples, sparks, electricity, and
explosions. Other shows can have massive amounts needing to be made,
depending on what the style and genre the story and world are set in.
Sometimes the FX animators create their own FX designs based upon the
storyboards and established art direction, other times dedicate 2D FX
animators become designers to create key poses and colors to make sure
the FX animations will stay on-style and consistent in its design and
appearance. FX design are often overlooked and usually grouped into the
Prop Design category of the design process.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes FX designs cross-over into character model sheets, these
could be special poses or custom design sheets to show how the FX are
functioning with the characters:</p>
<p>Character<img src="./images/unnamed_1021.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Character designers are essentially creating props all the time, the
clothes their characters wear, the glasses on their face, the hats on
their heads, as soon as they come off the character’s body technically
becomes a prop.</p>
<h3 id="walkthrough-the-process">Walkthrough the Process</h3>
<h4 id="pre-boards-and-post-boards">Pre-Boards and Post Boards</h4>
<p>While character design happens continually through the production of
each episode of an animated series, there are usually two primary
stages:</p>
<p>Designs done BEFORE the storyboard artists start <a
href="https://speakerdeck.com/sarahvettori/the-first-piece-storyboard&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865183898&amp;usg=AOvVaw29LuWdBbTXkAkMXNzJht-Z">boarding</a>,
in order to give the storyboard artists the reference they need to draw
the characters in their shots…</p>
<p>And designs done AFTER the storyboard is complete, wherein the
designers base their designs on the storyboard artists’ drawings.</p>
<p>The completed pack of design assets is something always in progress,
from first reading and analyzing the script, through the storyboards
stage and their revisions, then during character builds, and then even
last minute additions and changes during layout &amp; scene prep stages
(just before animators start to animate the characters in their shots),
and sometimes after animation has started. The odd thing here and there
will need a quick design, since often some changes occur throughout each
stage, and also, items get missed all the time and need to get caught
and designed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1501.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sometimes there’s a strict and detailed breakdown made of the script,
where most assets for characters, props and backgrounds are designed
before storyboards begin, this way the storyboard artist has all the
reference they need to plan out all their shots and sequences. Other
shows have a very small, loose, rough preliminary design pack made, with
barely any reference for the storyboard artist to use, giving the
storyboard artist more creative liberties to create the concept of these
designs, for you to use later to make the official design sheets out of.
In this method the storyboard artist is encouraged to create, invent,
expand upon the location designs, to make-up any secondary and
incidental characters,whatever costume changes required, and create
props/FX as needed, whether they were mentioned in the script or
not.</p>
<p>This leaves a long list of items for the character designer to
tackle, beyond all the assets mentioned in the initial script, but then
they have the storyboards as a rough reference to start from, to
eventually complete the list of design assets.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_788.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Incidental characters, designed using the storyboard as reference, is
a very common part of the job.</p>
<p>No two productions are alike and the role and scope of a character
designer’s job can change significantly depending on the production, the
pipeline, the supervisors/directors in charge and the style of the
show</p>
<h4 id="design-handout">Design Handout</h4>
<p>At the beginning of each episode, the character designer is given the
script to read in advance of their design handout.</p>
<p>The design handout is the meeting where character designers are
assigned their specific characters that they will need to design in
preparation for boards. Sometimes the designs made before boards are
called the <em>Fun Pack</em>.</p>
<p>This initial meeting, often called a Design Brief (or Briefing) is
basically where it is decided what character(s) will be assigned to
which artist and for what purpose. If the designer works directly for a
client, for example, this is the part of the process that includes their
communication with the person (Producer / Art Director / Supervisor)
regarding the character(s).</p>
<p>In this phase, the artist should know the core personality of said
character: is it a human, an animal, a creature, or an object (sometimes
combinations of a few of these). It’s not always obvious from the script
or story outline alone. This brief also includes a list of certain
personality traits and common emotional core values. Establishing the
overall mood and mentality this character will communicate to the
viewer. This list can be made by the designer by jotting down notes they
made while reading the script or during the meeting with the art
director or showrunner.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_957.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, if the project is an educational presentation aimed at
third graders, it will require a cute and cheerful character that will
appeal to children. Often your client may not be too certain or
rock-solid about the backstory or personality, so they offer suggestions
of what visual style they are looking for. They can instruct that the
overall mood must be very warm and welcoming, even silly and fun. They
may point you in the direction of a series, film, or short that they
want you to use as inspiration. This phase, depending on the role of the
character, is when the artists (or the clients) decide what the
characteristics are. Some of those fundamental questions could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the character’s age? Where is the character from?</li>
<li>What do they look like? What are their likes and dislikes?</li>
<li>What are the character’s dominant traits and personality?</li>
</ul>
<p>During this meeting the Showrunner and the Director of the episode
will also tell the designer if there are any particular attributes,
racial specificity or personal characteristics that they want the
designer to incorporate while designing.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This character has a kind of Ryan Gosling, comical-cool type
vibe.</em></li>
<li><em>This character is half Korean/half Puerto Rican so try to be
conscious of this while designing them.</em></li>
<li><em>This character is an old alien boss, think Mr. Burns; make him
frail, no teeth, hunchback, skinny limbs, big big-eyes, potbelly with a
large cape.</em></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1055.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The designers receive their character assignments based on several
factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The specific designer’s strengths and sensibilities</strong>
<ul>
<li>For example a character designer who is better with fashion may get
the majority of the costume designs. A character designer who
specializes in drawing animals will be favored to design the cast of
characters for a pride of lions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The availability of the designer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Because multiple episodes are in play at once, some designers may
wind up with more on their plate than others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The designer’s speed</strong>
<ul>
<li>If a design needs to be turned out fast, it will usually be handed
to the speedier designer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the character designer has their allotted characters, they head
back to their Cintiq/Tablet and get cracking.</p>

<h4 id="rough-sketches">Rough Sketches</h4>
<p>Using photo reference, online images, and any specifications from the
Director/Showrunner as their guide, the designer will start sketching
out their rough ideas for the character.</p>
<p>After doing any necessary research on the subject, the designer will
also incorporate their own taste and interpretation to give their
designs flair and use their own artistic vision to really push the
design.</p>
<p>The designer will create 3-6 different variations of sketches for the
character with different <a

shapes</a>, outfits, hair styles, etc -- this is the visual
development/concept art stage. The goal is to create a nice variety of
potential directions that still serve the story’s designated
characteristics. Make several iterations and go through your <a

<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The script calls for a “<em>gym teacher</em>” character… Are they
tall? Short? Lean? Buff? Super buff?</li>
<li>The script calls for “<em>kids in the classroom</em>”… Are they 6,
8, 10 years old? Are they bored? Rowdy? Energetic?</li>
</ul>
<p>The character designer explores all options.</p>

<h4 id="design-review">Design Review</h4>
<p>Once the designers have their rough sketches lined up, it’s time for
the review!</p>
<p>The Design Review is a meeting where the Art Director (main overseer
of the overall look of the series) and the Showrunners look at the new
designs and give their feedback and notes.</p>
<p>Usually the result of this initial design review will be a
frankensteined new design, based on specific parts from the different
sketches submitted.</p>
<p>The Showrunner might say: <em>“I like the head from #1, but the body
from #3 and let’s use the hair from #6”</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Showrunner or Art Director will just like the one whole
design with just some tweaks and adjustments needed -- “<em>Let’s go
with #4, just shorten the hair, make the legs a bit longer</em>”.</p>
<p>But the Frankenstein-ing approach is far more common.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_398.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_126.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h4 id="revisions-and-revisions-and-revisions">Revisions and Revisions
and Revisions</h4>
<p>The process of <em>Design Review</em> &gt;&gt;
<em>Tweaks/Adjustments</em> &gt;&gt; <em>Repeat</em>, can go on several
more times until the Art Director and then the Showrunner is satisfied
with the design.</p>
<p>It can take a while to get the exact look they are going for, to make
certain it fits just right for the purposes of the show.</p>
<p>Usually if the small tweaks persist past a certain point, a Line
Producer or Producer will step in and tell the design team and the
Showrunner when time has run out, and to move on with the latest
version, applying the final round of notes. Production Managers and Line
Producers keep an eye on schedules and budgets, they let the creative
process grow, flourish and expand as it’s needed, but deadlines and
deliverables can only be pushed so far, then they intervene to make sure
the flow of production doesn’t get bogged down for too long.</p>
<p><strong>Red-lining</strong>, this the process an art director takes
to draw-over your work with visual notes:<img

<h4 id="rotations">Rotations</h4>
<p>Once a rough 3/4 front design of the character is somewhat settled
and approved, it’s time for the designer to turn the character!</p>
<p>TURN- AROUNDS are the process by which the character designer draws
the design in different rotations: 3/4 Front, Front, Profile (Side), 3/4
Back, Back.</p>
<p>In TV animation, <a
href="https://youtu.be/dFRpWqY2iwo&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865195453&amp;usg=AOvVaw1msoKNNmbhw-iDmhp3MHVZ">turnarounds</a>
are essential.</p>
<p>They are the guides that show the storyboard artists and more
importantly, the animators, how the character looks from different
angles and shows them how to keep the character on-model as they move
them through different poses. On rigged character builds the builds
artists use the designs to setup and assemble the character as a digital
puppet for animators to move around and pose them in their scenes to
prep them to be animated.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_628.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1041.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1010.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<h4 id="does-this-turn">Does This Turn?</h4>
<p>In order for the Builds team to construct and setup your characters
into a proper and efficient rig (and for the animation to be fluid and
believable), character designs NEED to be able to turn properly… and
often times during this stage of rotating a character, designers will
realize where certain features on the character do not turn well.
Sometimes more flat and graphic designs are made out of many cheats
where they are only meant to look good in a certain way at specific
view.</p>
<p>Common things that can come up are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Body shapes or costuming that looks awkward from different
angles</li>
<li>Facial features that do not translate to certain angles well (ie:
when the nose doesn’t work in the front view)</li>
<li>Clunky or angular parts of the design that are messy to turn</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_074.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1165.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>If a design doesn’t turn well, chances are it won’t animate well.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the designer often has to keep tweaking and
changing the design to get it to rotate just right.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_065.gif" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_623.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1125.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>By Parker Nielsen</p>
<p>Find the supervisor who will lead the <strong>animation
crew</strong>, get advice from them and watch through the
animatic/storyboards (if possible) to see if the character is meant to
only be viewed in certain ways. This is because turning their head/body
into these views might be quick-and-snappy in order to keep the
stylistic qualities of the designs.</p>
<p>Communicating also with the department that will convert your designs
into <strong>builds</strong> is important because oftentimes you can’t
be drawing attention to the fact that the character does not translate
well in a three dimensional way. Some designs have lots of “cheats” to
make them turn. The cheats make the design look good for each view,
however it’s made to look appealing with its graphic shapes, even though
it may not be actually possible to three-dimensionally turn as a
rotation, and that’s fine for more stylized characters.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1324.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_829.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<h4 id="clean-lines">Clean Lines</h4>
<p>Once the character designer gets the design to rotate and has the
roughs approved, they start cleaning up the line work… and once again
more inconsistencies or odd things may arise in this stage, final
detailing and fine-tuning in this stage of tying things down.</p>
<p>Designs are often tweaked again as they are cleaned up because the
tighter line work makes design issues more obvious.</p>
<p>The entire character design process for the pre-board characters
usually takes about 2 weeks from handout to clean-up.</p>
<p>Of course this can vary, depending on the production.</p>

src="./images/unnamed_1348.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h4 id="is-the-design-finished">Is The Design Finished?</h4>
<p>Designs may still be in flux right up until the episode actually goes
out to go get animated.</p>
<p>The storyboards can also greatly affect the design.</p>
<p>For Example: The Director may request design changes based on new
story changes or physical actions required of the characters made in the
boards.</p>
<p>“I have a scene where Character X pulls up their hood to cover them
from the rain, so let’s be sure to give their jacket a hood”</p>

src="./images/unnamed_050.gif" alt="image" /></p>
<p>DESIGN and BOARDS are very collaborative, almost in a hidden way,
some shows independently operate in their own bubbles but rely on each
other to use each other’s work as reference, other times they’re often
informing each other both ways. The Director and Art Director usually
work together to make sure their respective teams are alert to the
shifts in design and story.</p>
<p>Another collaborative overlap are the riggers, who come in after the
characters are completed in design and proceed to build and set up the
designs for the animators to use. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DMv7uwqgzDXQ%26ab_channel%3DHarmonywithSu-Lynn&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865201099&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zN3QV7h12OJXNchGFRwHF">Rigging</a>
is a crucial process in animation that enables characters and objects to
move fluidly.</p>
<p>Rigging in 2D animation is the process of creating a digital skeleton
for characters or objects. This skeleton allows animators to control and
manipulate movements with precision.</p>
<p>Effective rigging is essential for producing smooth, believable
animations.</p>
<p>Key components of 2D rigging include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joints and bones</li>
<li>Control handles</li>
<li>Deformation tools</li>
<li>Hierarchy systems</li>
</ul>
<p>By setting up these elements properly, they ensure that characters
can be easily posed and animated. This saves time and enhances the
overall quality of the animation.</p>
<p>As a rigger, they’re primary responsibility is to build the
underlying structure that brings characters to life. They work closely
with animators and character designers to create rigs that are both
functional and efficient.</p>
<p>Typical tasks include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Analysing character designs</li>
<li>Placing joints strategically</li>
<li>Setting up control systems</li>
<li>Testing rig functionality</li>
</ol>
<p>Riggers need a combination of technical skills and artistic
understanding. They must anticipate how characters will move and ensure
the rig supports these movements seamlessly.</p>

<h4 id="post-board-designs">Post Board Designs</h4>
<p>Once the boards are done, the character designers may receive new
designs in addition to whatever designs need to be tweaked based on
boards.</p>
<p>To save designers time, during that initial <strong>Handout</strong>,
Directors can call out which characters the board artists can board
WITHOUT a pre-design…</p>
<p>But once the <a

are done, those boarded characters will still need to be designed
properly.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1163.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Screenshots of the boards are sent to the character designers who
then create on-model character designs based on what the storyboard
artists roughed in.</p>
<p>It is very common for storyboards to be completed with un-approved
character designs in them, storyboards are rough, never 100% on-model or
on-style, and the characters sketched in the boards are meant to be
place-holders and used as reference for the process of creating the
final designs. Then the rigs created from these designs will be the ones
placed in &amp; set up in each individual scene for the crew to animate
with.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<h4 id="alternates-and-multiple-versions">Alternates and Multiple
Versions</h4>
<p>These can be sometimes referred to as “ALTs” -- these are designs
required for hair and costume changes, but is also used for different
states as well, like a charred or burned or wet versions of the
character design.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_070.png" alt="image" /> <img

src="./images/unnamed_1217.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h4 id="expressions-mouth-charts-special-poses">Expressions, Mouth
Charts &amp; Special Poses</h4>
<p>Another stage in the TV animation character design process is
designing <strong>expressions</strong> and <strong>mouth
charts</strong>. Once the boards are finished, the character designer
will typically design mouth charts for the characters to be sent to the
Builds team along with the turn-around which will have the characters
get assembled and rigged into a build then sent to the animation team,
along with the animatic (the storyboard assembled into a video with
voices and sound effects to have the episode constructed into a
blueprint showing all the camera moves, the length of each shot, and
with the episode as a whole, at the proper length of time.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_868.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_881.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The mouth chart will guide the animators when they animate the
characters speaking. They show what the character’s mouth shapes are for
the different syllables for all characters with speaking roles, this is
for all the lip sync animation they’ll have to do. This ensures that the
character remains consistent as they speak their dialogue.</p>
<p>Expressions sheets are usually only made for primary characters, to
show how to stay on-style as a spectrum of expressions are made as
reference for animators to have so they can understand the characters
better for their facial anatomy and range of emotions.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_706.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_673.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1433.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_686.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>A <strong>Special Pose</strong> is a specific character design based
on extreme or exaggerated or purposefully off-model drawings done by the
board artist in the storyboard.</p>
<p>The character designer will tie down this extreme pose and make it
more on-model, while keeping the same energy found in the board
drawing.</p>
<p>This is to help the animation team know how to interpret and handle
the very exaggerated or very specific pose in the board so it doesn’t
break style. These are usually drawn by the best artists on the crew and
can be the most fun (and most difficult) to do.</p>
<p>Sample of Special Poses with storyboard comparisons:</p>

<h4 id="do-character-designers-color-design">Do Character Designers
Color Design?</h4>
<p>Typically NO.</p>
<p>Most TV animation production pipelines have separate artists known as
Color Stylists or Color Designers whose job is to color the characters
and props.</p>
<p>TV animation character designers usually work predominantly in black
and white.</p>
<p>Some character designers may use gray tones in their designs to help
break up the linework, to make the designs clear for presentation
purposes. Blocking out different shapes and subtly guiding the color
stylist in the direction they were thinking.</p>
<p>Every show is it’s own unique animal and there may very well be
instances where you may be allowed (or asked) to color your characters
designs. Especially on smaller productions where character designers are
asked to complete many aspects of the design process.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1052.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you happen to have a knack for color, you may be asked to do color
concepts in your rough drawings as well, at the very least, to get the
process going.</p>

<h4 id="who-do-i-work-with---part-one">Who Do I Work With? - Part
one</h4>
<p>Primarily, character designers work closest with the Art
Director.</p>
<p>The art director (or design supervisor) is the foremost person in
charge of the overall look of the series and tracking all assets. They
guide and support the designers to make sure all the character designs
stay ON-STYLE with the look of the show.</p>
<p>Character Designers will also receive notes from Directors and
Showrunners. They may communicate with COlor Stylists to discuss their
ideas for the color treatment on certain things. For example: “<em>I
thought maybe this character’s hair could be two-toned</em>”.</p>

<h4 id="who-do-i-affect---part-one">Who Do I Affect? - Part one</h4>
<p>Character designers affect the <a

artists</a> but they are also heavily affected by them, along with
directors as well. The way designers are used for the story can greatly
dictate what the design needs. Designs and Boards are two very
interdependent departments, and are often very symbiotic.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1559.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another department they communicate with are the artists that take
the designs and create rigs out of your designs. The Builds team take
the turnarounds and assemble it all into a model that the animators can
use and manipulate in their scenes.</p>

<h3 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the Trade</h3>
<p>For the most part, character designers in TV animation are working
with Adobe Photoshop, or similar programs like Procreate. Photoshop
provides a tidy UI to both sketch and polish designs and is a software
any aspiring designer needs to be fluent in.</p>
<p>There are many other illustration software like Gimp, Affinity, Clip
Studio Paint, Krita, Paint Tool SAI, and Procreate. In reality, they can
ALL do the job very well. Anything that allows you to export layers as
bitmap (PNG alpha) images for the next artist to grab and use to build
the character as a 2D rig is all you need. Your employer or supervisor
may have specific requirements to use certain software, templates and
resolution settings, these are all easy to ascertain and adapt to. Ask
your client/director so that you can get familiar with the tools and
templates ahead of time.</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Pertaining to creations of
any artistic works, usually referred to as “IP”. It can include designs,
symbols, logos, names, and images used in all film, television or video
games. It can be for individual characters, the series or film title,
and even the concept of the world and story they reside in. A ‘property’
is always referring to the concept or show itself. See more general info
on the term <a
href="https://youtu.be/UqZJPuyK9VY?t%3D4&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865220481&amp;usg=AOvVaw16uIQ1Q2dT46etUqR3GqeD">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>POC:</strong> Proof of Concept is material (artwork or
writings) typically derived from a pitch or pilot project, which
demonstrates that a design concept or story proposal is feasible, and
shows what the idea actually is. In animation it comes from pitching and
attempting to sell a new intellectual property as an idea for a
potential series or film and it applies for series, shorts and
videogames. Creating a proof of concept for a new animated film or
series could involve creating a pitch deck, which is a document or
package of writings and artwork aimed at outlining what the concept is
about and how it looks, usually containing character designs, background
designs, character descriptions and the story premise. Sometimes an
animated teaser or sizzle reel is made to show off the look and feel of
what the animated property would be and these are also called a Proof of
Concept.</li>
<li><strong>Public Domain:</strong> This refers to creative materials
that are not protected by intellectual property laws such as copyright,
trademark, or patent laws. The public owns these works, not an
individual author or artist. Anyone can use a public domain work without
obtaining permission, but no one can ever own it. Researching which
characters are in public domain can help insure that and resemblances
you do create for your own characters will or will not be in danger of
any copyright infringements.</li>
<li><strong>NDA:</strong> A Non Disclosure Agreement is one of the first
forms a producer will have you sign for them, even before a work
contract. This is because an NDA is a legally binding contract that
establishes a confidential relationship between you and your employer
(producer/studio/client). The individual or parties signing the
agreement all agree that the sensitive information they may obtain will
not be made available to others. An NDA may also be referred to as a
confidentiality agreement. If you are employed by a studio, oftentimes
you need to sign one just to receive the visuals or written info about
the characters/productions before your studio bids on the production or
negotiates for the contract and budget, long before the work begins.
<ul>
<li>Non-disclosure agreements are also common for studios entering into
negotiations with other studios, or a producer wanting to share
information (scripts, designs, discussions about the production) with
you, or the studio you’re with. They allow the parties to share
sensitive information without fear that it will end up in the hands of
competitors. In this case, it may be called a mutual non-disclosure
agreement. They are all the same in their intentions and purpose. In the
video game industry there are very strict processes for security and not
allowing any information about their projects to leak out to the public.
They are very common and nothing to be afraid of, it means that you
agree to not talk about the property with anyone else outside the
production and your bosses. This includes anything online; emails,
texts, conversations, and social media.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> A human resources term referring to the
process of introducing a newly hired employee into an organization. For
a new designer in an animation or gaming studio, it’s an important part
of helping employees understand their new position and job requirements.
This usually consists of tours and handing the new employee some
documents showing contact info of your leads/supervisors, descriptions
of the production you are working on, getting familiar with the file
server, workflow guides, schedules and lists of deadlines, info as to
how to submit your work, and receiving any references for the tasks that
are required of you.</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline:</strong> A term that refers to the <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mLC-wgty1U4RlkKrgG7Evo7JsuvXcscb/view?usp%3Dshare_link&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865224174&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qBkipi64jQQE1jItxxSrI">workflow</a>
for the entire production. The bigger the production, the bigger the
crew, the bigger and longer the pipeline. Design departments sit near
the beginning of the production pipeline, but various forms of design
tasks continue throughout the entire production, especially on an
episodic-based series, and even in feature films where designs are
needed even in final visual effects stages. See <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOkFs8parmNUKMasWgX_GgAEufqa2jH-UERkOqb-A_g/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865224596&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Vjkw5uYmGyuBrR22CSP9x">this</a>
for where and how designs fit into the pipeline of a typical 2D animated
series, and see <a
href="https://youtu.be/K5dr92VgZwI&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865224728&amp;usg=AOvVaw1pJyp7djBa07gFvAk5yzMi">this</a>
for how the production portion of the pipeline works in a 3D animated
feature film.</li>
<li><strong>Demographic:</strong> This term is used to describe who the
designs (and the production) are aimed for. In most cases there’s an age
range (or a target audience) for the animated characters being created
along with the stories &amp; world they’re a part of. While designing
the character you should keep in mind the nature of the audience viewing
these characters. For example, if you are designing the characters for
children it should be designed with basic shapes and colors. The genre
and rating on the game or the genre and rating of the film you are
designing for is usually your main indicator of what age group this
production will be targeted for. Designs for a horror game will have a
very different art direction than what you will find in a kids’ game
like Minecraft, Lego, or Little Big Planet. A game or an animated series
for mature audiences will have characters looking differently compared
to characters found in a game or series made for kids under 12
year-olds, and even more different for preschoolers.</li>
<li><strong>S&amp;P:</strong> Standards and Practices, the term used by
broadcasters and networks as a set of corporate rules to follow to
self-regulate the content on the animated series, strongly depending on
the demographic, the younger the intended audience the longer the list
for S&amp;P for everyone to follow. For example, there are long lists of
S&amp;P for children’s or pre-school series, since it’s intended for
young audiences, for adult animated content, the S&amp;P regulations are
far less. For PG or Teen related demographics, the level of violence
depicted on screen must be limited. S&amp;P passes are made during
script writing, designs, storyboarding, and final animation stages.
Revision notes may come in on character designs in order to remove or
change aspects of the design they may deem as inappropriate or not
on-brand.</li>
<li><strong>EP:</strong> Executive Producers consult on the production
and provide specialist expertise. They may also help other <a
href="https://floobynooby.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-is-animation-producer.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865226899&amp;usg=AOvVaw0FjqScibRBxOvUE9gQTo9k">producers</a>
on the business side of things by facilitating the finances and
contracts between broadcaster, distributor and the service studio
providing the design and animation work. Some producers are in charge of
fundraising and marketing for the production. The title of executive
producer may also be credited to the original creator of the source
material that is being adapted, and as a result, may also serve as head
writer and showrunner for the series. They are often the ones seeking
out and hiring the writers, directors and other key personnel to get the
production started once it is greenlit and set to go.</li>
<li><strong>PM:</strong> Production Manager, the person to go to for
contracts, schedules, and payment questions and concerns. They manage
all the stages of the production’s deadlines and track each artist’s
daily and weekly progress. They can often act as the human resources
person as well, but usually are the ones most in communications with the
client/executive producer.</li>
<li><strong>Showrunner:</strong> The series showrunner is the person
with the overall vision for the production. Writing, producing, and
creative leadership is their main focus. They work closely with voice
casting, voice recording, scriptwriting, character development, and
guiding the heads of departments like episodic directors, art directors,
animation supervisors, storyboard supervisors, and post production
supervisors. This is to ensure that all aspects of the production in
each stage on the creative level, are on-style and up to the appropriate
levels of quality.
<ul>
<li>Oftentimes the showrunner is the creator of the series concept, and
sometimes this role is in two people’s hands, where they split the
responsibilities - usually one showrunner focuses on scripts, voices,
storyboards, sound designs &amp; music, and the other showrunner
overlooks designs, animation, backgrounds, colors, compositing/FX and
quality assurance. Sometimes they act as the head writer, supervising
director, or creative director for the series. Other times they will
communicate all their thoughts about character design to the art
director so that the info can be transferred to the designers. Other
times the design style comes from their personal style directly, so a
designer would work closely with showrunners at the beginning, to
achieve the look they’re going for.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Design Coordinator:</strong> This can have many other names,
such as, Assets Manager, Design Supervisor, Artistic Coordinator, but
their role is to assist the Art Director in managing the deliveries,
approvals, versions, and scheduling of the design process. When there’s
dozens of episodes overlapping, the number of characters, props, and key
locations that accumulate on the production can go into the hundreds,
and when the Art Director is focusing purely on the creative &amp;
artistic side of things while conducting quality control amongst their
designers, sometimes a design coordinator is needed to manage all the
many lists of assets and design elements on the show.</li>
<li><strong>Pilot:</strong> The first episode of a series, created to
test the concept, characters, and overall potential of the show before
committing to a full season. It serves as a proof of concept and a pitch
to networks and streamers, showcasing the show's premise and style. If
the pilot is successful, the show is "picked up" and a full season is
produced, with the pilot often becoming the premiere episode.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Development:</strong> The building blocks for any
type of visual art, from concept art to graphic design, illustration,
animation, and gaming. The scope of a visual development artist’s work
gives them a level of professional creative control that is vital to the
entire process. This comes from the versatility of their work being
applicable to a wide variety of media formats. They’re responsible for
creating the mood, tone, and color palette of these worlds created from
the writers, and creators of the property. No task or element is too
large or small; as a visual development artist, you can design sets,
environments, characters, clothing, vehicles, props, furniture,
lighting, visual effects, and just about everything else that appears in
all aspects of a visual work. More info <a

on the work that is made to develop the Art Direction for a film or
series.</li>
<li><strong>Shape Language:</strong> A concept used in design and
animation to communicate a mood, story, or history behind the design.
Giving familiar meanings to the shapes the characters are made with.
When used in character, prop, and background design, shapes can tell a
story, show personality, and elicit an emotional response in the viewer
without using any words or movements. Depending on the character’s
overall shape or combination of shapes that make up their physicality,
it can give visual hints as to the character’s nature and core identity.
Design Language and Shape Design are alternate terms used for the same
theory.</li>
<li><strong>Thumbnails:</strong> Small rough sketches, drawn fast to
create lots of ideas for designs or poses, and used to explore various
concepts, creating a way to visually rehearse what works and what
doesn’t.</li>
<li><strong>Reference:</strong> Materials, assets, and images provided
to (or researched by) the artist to have as a strict or casual guide to
follow. These can be used for <a
href="https://youtu.be/HXFj_0wohI8?t%3D23&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865232413&amp;usg=AOvVaw1apNh3zdEmYV2xFjMlM2GA">inspiration</a>
to the art direction of the property being designed.</li>
<li><strong>Turnaround:</strong> The rotation of the character
displaying multiple views/sides to be used as reference for the building
and animating of the character, see <a
href="https://youtu.be/yvUkaBhwAFY?t%3D91&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865232723&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_JRWCb5ku3oe_sHx08hUD">this
guide</a> on the process.</li>
<li><strong>Construction:</strong> Refers to when you’re breaking down
your character into their basic shapes and forms to reveal the inner
structure. Construction lines are usually the geometry, cross-hairs, and
guidelines that are drawn through the character’s features to show the
three-dimensional aspects of their body parts.

<li><strong>Anthropomorphic:</strong> Human-like physical attributes in
a non-human character, usually referring to an animal character that
acts human, as seen in many animated properties and storybooks. Not just
biped animals but 4-legged animals standing up-right. These are <a
href="https://ie.pinterest.com/characterdesigh/creature-design-anthropomorphic-animals/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865233558&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GsCCctEt8bpnEIZ_kTi3U">animals</a>
depicted as walking, talking, dressing, and behaving like people. Even
animated smoke that takes the form of a person can be described as
anthropomorphic.

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Asset:</strong> A general term for all aspects of designs
and rigs, including all states and versions of characters, props, FX,
and backgrounds. Even though they go through their various stages of
rough, color, builds, etc., they all need to be tracked for the progress
of each design element, and these are all referred to as ‘Assets’. On
big productions there can be Assets Managers and Design Coordinators in
charge of tracking all assets, which is usually referring to all the
individual visual elements seen on-screen. Designated asset names and
numbers are determined after the script is complete and then again after
storyboards are complete.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Sheet:</strong> A spreadsheet outlining all design
elements found in the production. In an animated series all characters,
props, FX, and environments/locations are listed and cataloged for which
shots they all appear in for each episode. At first these are broken
down from a script as a preliminary design pass, then after storyboards
are complete, any additional designs created are extracted from the
animatic to then be added to the library of design assets to be
officially made. As the production moves forward and more episodes are
completed and locked at script and storyboard stages, the more lead
sheets are made and updated. These breakdowns are sometimes called a
Route Sheet, Assets List, Design List or Log List. A script ‘breakdown’
is the process of extracting all the information from the story to
produce lists of all design assets like this, the process is done again
after a storyboard/animatic is finalized to list all the on-screen
design elements that were added by the story artists.</li>
<li><strong>Design Brief:</strong> A meeting to discuss the design
tasks, happening just before the first pass of the design process. On a
feature film this can happen for each new sequence that goes into
production, on a series it happens before each episode enters
production, usually every week or two. It’s accompanied with a document
created by the showrunner, creative director, art director, or episodic
director to give to the design crew as a guide for each episode’s
breakdown, for any new design elements that need to be created. It’s a
process usually reserved for 2D or 3D animated shows where each script
is analyzed and visual reference is compiled for specific direction on
how to produce the new key backgrounds and characters found in the
story.
<ul>
<li>Also known as a <strong>Design Kickoff</strong> or <strong>Design
Launch</strong>. These meetings with the designers have the art director
or series director talk about the specifics of the design tasks that are
next to be started in the production. These are discussions on the
direction and approach for new characters or character
re-dresses.Briefings can look like excerpts from the script pages with
images in the margins (on the side of the text); Showing reference
images like sketches, photos, and thumbnails for the artist to follow as
visual guides. Other briefings can look like a simple document or design
kit with reference images and descriptions, provided by the
director.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Design Kit:</strong> Usually something handed out during a
Design Brief, these are also known as a Ref Sheet, Guide Sheet or
Reference Pack. It’s a document containing various visual references or
guidelines for particular designs that can be used by the designers as a
target to have in mind while they work. A Design Kit or Design Handout
can even be a “how-to guide” with files and imagery showing how to
create certain artistic aspects of the design style, it can have
tutorials on how to achieve a certain look or effect. These sometimes
include focused step-by-step processes and technical information as
well. These kits can be handed out during or just after the design
launch and are made for designers to have them to better know what the
intended look and style of specific design tasks they are assigned,
usually made after the storyboards are done.</li>
<li><strong>Show Bible:</strong> Can be referred to as a Design Bible
when specifically made for Art Direction. Show Bibles contain all the
general information needed for the design team to use as reference for
the overall style of the series for both characters and backgrounds. It
can also have guidelines for how to handle and produce other aspects of
the production as well, like the writing style (for the scriptwriters),
the shooting style (for the storyboard artists), and the sound design
style (for the musical score and sound effects artists).</li>
<li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> A list of what stages will need to be
delivered for your work. Sometimes there’s specific deadline dates to
follow, other times it’s more of a general weekly arrangement of
deliverables to submit for review for each character and for each stage
of the design process. The actual design package put together that is
needed to go out every week for a client or showrunner to review can
also be referred to as ‘deliverables’.</li>
<li><strong>Redress:</strong> A character that’s already been designed
and finished, but is now partially re-designed to create new and
different versions. Usually alternate varieties like hair style and
costume changes. Examples can be stuff like adding a backpack, having
wet hair, added gloves, torn clothes, different boots, burned/charred
clothes, damaged armor, muddy clothes, or a new hat/hooded jacket pulled
over the head.

<li><strong>ALT:</strong> Alternate or Alterative, usually referring to
an alternative to a design. When presenting ALTs, you usually show
different versions as options to use, sometimes minor design or color
variations.

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Off-Model:</strong> A term used to point out how a design or
the drawing/posing of a character is off-style or inaccurate to how they
should look. When some feedback is given on some designs, character
layouts, or animation poses the notes can refer to them as being
“off-model”. They need to be revised and redrawn to be “on-model” by
using the reference shown in the provided revision notes, style guides
and model sheets. Sometimes moments are drawn to purposefully look
off-model to capture the intent of the scene for the more extreme nature
of the expression/pose at the time, <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HEDkGlsFUVJL25Ok15HkS0mgJmE81vTg/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865239980&amp;usg=AOvVaw1QZ-B0ebVQRqJbBsW8q4TT">Ren
&amp; Stimpy</a> famously did this constantly. Other times the designs
go off-model but for the purpose of creating or copying another art
direction style entirely, therefore creating new models to be used for
just a scene or specific to that sequence or episode, as often seen in
<a
href="https://youtu.be/S5yfNacgcus?t%3D15&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865240288&amp;usg=AOvVaw3I5Y5DW_lYh3fZdUMvLq5c">Teen
Titans Go!</a></li>
<li><strong>3pt, 4pt, 5pt:</strong> Abbreviations for how many views to
illustrate when creating the rotations for the characters, for example -
3 point turnarounds are usually Front, 3/4 Front, 3/4 Back views - 5
point turnarounds are usually Front, 3/4 Front, Side, 3/4 Back, Back
views. This can range between 2pt and 16pt.</li>
<li><strong>Lineup:</strong> When one view of multiple characters is
placed on one sheet to see them all at once for <a
href="#size-comparison-charts">size comparison</a> purposes. It’s
important to show the scale of all your characters relative to each
other.</li>
<li><strong>Fun Pack:</strong> The pre-board design bundle, all the
design sheets for the primary characters and locations, sometimes as
rough designs, to be used as reference for the storyboard artists. This
is usually the bare minimum design sheets a board artist needs to know
what the cast and settings depicted in the script look like. Final model
sheets then builds happen during and after the storyboard process.</li>
<li><strong>MDP:</strong> Main Design Pack, the completed sets of all
the main characters and background designs, to have as reference for all
departments.</li>
<li><strong>Style Guide:</strong> This expands upon the Pitch Deck/Show
Bible, having elements of the model pack but refers to all character and
prop/location design references for the film or series, and expands upon
it. With a focus on guides for how to create the backgrounds and
characters in its particular style. It covers many aspects of the
production’s art direction; as shown <a

They can be small or large and elaborate documents that outline DOs
&amp; DONTs for the animation teams and background painters, or specific
“how-to-draw” playbooks for the design crew.

Style guides are a great way to bring together a group of people to
create one cohesive style for the design and layout/animation teams. <a
href="#style-guides">Style guides</a> can even be created before the
concept goes into production, and later the MDP becomes included in the
style guide.</li>
<li>Thinking about what your style guide would look like is a great
place to start when developing your show or film concept as a pitch
idea, you begin by laying down all the visual rules and standards. These
can also be called a Design Bible, usually seen in animated series, and
one can be made for each department: Script Bible, Storyboard Bible,
Animation Bible, each one made specific for the team of people working
in those stages of production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Workbook:</strong> Usually used in 2D animated feature film
productions, it is an expanded upon style guide/lookbook &amp;
background design guide. It is made during the character design /
production design phase and it keeps growing in size and scope while
overlapping storyboards and layout stages. It’s a collection of artwork
and guidelines for design, color, lighting, staging and layouts, and
handed out to all artists to use as reference.</li>
<li><strong>Readable:</strong> A term used to identify how much a design
or pose can be “read”. Meaning the more readable a design is, the more
clear and recognizable it will be. A design that doesn't read refers to
a character visual that is difficult to understand or identify at a
glance, often due to confusing silhouettes, overly complex details, or a
lack of distinct features that make it hard to discern their personality
or role in a story.</li>
<li><strong>Plusing:</strong> A broad term you get from notes made by a
director or producer, generally meaning to plus the design further,
adding more quality and refinement to a certain area or to the overall
artwork.</li>
<li><strong>Naming Convention:</strong> A system established on how to
label and name the designs relative to how the digital files are named.
There’s a million different ways of doing so, and most of the time your
supervisor/director on the production will establish a template for you
to follow.
<ul>
<li>Char_Julian_CLR_TRN_V05</li>
<li>Char_Maximus_CLN_TRN_V04</li>
<li>Char_RoyBatty_RGH_TRN_V03</li>
<li>Here’s a common template to use for the asset naming method. This
one shows the first part identifying the asset as a character, the
second part is the name of the character, then the status being concept
art or rough or clean line art or color, then the state that it is a
turnaround, and then the version number. You can have acronyms of the
series name and the season and episode numbers and short forms for Rough
(RGH) Clean-up (CLN) and Color (CLR) and many others that a supervisor
or director usually determines.</li>
<li>You can also have the series abbreviated name and season+episode
number as shown here…</li>
<li>JT_S01E10_Cha_MrEagle_CON_TRN_V02</li>

to the lines can be used. Depending on the art direction, sometimes a
much thicker outline is required (like Dexter’s Laboratory and The Grim
Adventures of Billy and Mandy), or very thin linework (like Family Guy
and Bob’s Burgers), or wobbly/boiling linework (like Ed, Edd &amp;
Eddy), or thick-to-thin tapered lines (like Sam &amp; Max, The Hollowand
Primal), or a messy dry brush style (like Foster’s Home for Imaginary
Friends and Jacob Two-Two), or a loose/sketchy line style (like Tante
Hilda), or a graphite pencil-textured line art style (like Penn Zero and
Green Eggs &amp; Ham), or a nearly lineless style (like Samurai Jack).
Search up all of these, have fun collecting design styles!

<li><strong>Line Weight:</strong> The thickness of your lines. Sometimes
referred to as Line Gauge.</li>
<li><strong>Line Value:</strong> The color and lightness/darkness of
your lines.</li>
<li><strong>Self-traced:</strong> Also known as self-colored or
self-inked, referring to the colored line art in your design. The line
work is sometimes just a lighter or darker version of the base fill
color found around the line, instead of the typical black lines on a
character design.

<li>Example; Spongebob’s colored outlines are just a darker tone from
his base skin color. See how Daffy’s arms and facial features have
outline colors turning white when crossing over the body or line work
needing to be visible for expressions - this way they don’t get lost as
the dark-on-dark color overlaps. <a

designs</a> like water, fire, and smoke are often made of colored
outlines, or no lines at all.</li>
<li>Self-traced lines can be used to make the lines visible when they
would normally disappear or blend in too much, or can simply be painted
lines, anything other than the default black tone, to make the linework
stand out more clearly. Another example is when you need to isolate the
edges of where the shadows are on your black-and-white character
designs.</li>

underneath a design element or body part, usually hair, capes, cloaks or
even an arm that is overlapping the torso.

<li><strong>Economy of Line:</strong> The concept of the line economy is
a familiar one to anyone who has studied ﬁgure drawing or has done
classical animation. Basically, it means that we should strive to draw
efﬁciently by using fewer lines to say what we need to say, rather than
a lot of unnecessary lines that lack a sense of intent. In character
design this translates to visually depicting everything you need without
unnecessary details, capturing the shapes, forms and personalities with
as few lines as possible. This is associated with the term ‘line
mileage’ which means the amount of lines drawn in a design,
illustration, or any hand-drawn animation scene. The more line mileage a
design has, the longer it takes to re-draw that design over and over
again.

<li><strong>Cel Shading:</strong> A technique used in illustrations and
animation to give 3D objects and characters a more 2D/cartoon-like
appearance. The term "cel" refers to celluloid, the clear plastic sheets
that were once used in traditional animation to create <a

a rendering technique designed to make 3D computer graphics appear to be
flat by replacing smoothly mixed in gradient shaders from the shadows,

means drawing all the pieces in full that are hidden by other
overlapping body parts. This is to set it up for the <a

once completed, get handed over to scene setup and then for animators to
use in their shots. Often referred to as Builds or Models in 3D/CG
animated productions. Also referred to as Puppets or Rigs for
Stop-motion productions where the 2D designs are translated into
handmade sculpts and fabricated into 3D-printed body parts to be
assembled with armatures for them to be posed, animated, and filmed.

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Referring to Stock Art or Stock Animation.
It’s when there's a pre-made set of designs, animated movements/cycles
or body parts that animators use to recycle and implement into their
scenes. Stock Hands could be a library of hand poses that animators
extract from a build to use in their scene. Stock Walk Cycle would be an
animated walk that was created for animators to grab and insert into
their scenes to save them the trouble of re-doing one from scratch.
Actions and poses like Jumps, Turns, Blinks, Runs, Expressions and Mouth
Shapes (mouth charts for lip sync) can all be considered Stock Art to be
saved, archived, and re-used by the builds &amp; animation crew when
needed.</li>
<li><strong>Character Layout:</strong> On a 3D/CG production this is the
process of setting up the initial <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D4S7d7w7Ip0k%26ab_channel%3DJovanTomasevic&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865254929&amp;usg=AOvVaw20xzk_s0sAoa-k6Paza3B0">staging
of a scene</a>, including camera angles, character positions, and key
movements to match and improve upon the storyboard’s composition and
shot framing. This sets up the scene to be prepped for the animators to
start on their shots. On a hand-drawn/2D animated production this is a
rough posing pass made after storyboards are completed on a
traditionally-animated series or film. This is where you draw out the
extremes and the main tent poles of the character staging to plot out
the acting and action along with the camera angle &amp; framing. Special
Poses and Character Layout work can be a great start on your road to
becoming a character designer, as work like this shows your ability to
draw consistently and on-model, while displaying artistic skill, speed,
and diversity in your draftsmanship.

<li><strong>Special Poses:</strong> When a designer draws certain
moments from the storyboard that need more attention to make sure
they’re clear for the animator. Similar to character layouts, where the
artist essentially does a re-draw of the storyboard pose to be more
on-style and more specific, this can include forced perspective,
difficult angles, or a very extreme/exaggerated or particular pose of
the character as well. A director or supervisor chooses which drawings
get to be made into special poses. These are moments that are either
pivotal to the episode or gags that need to make a super clear
translation from the storyboard to the final animation. Sometimes these
special poses are meant to purposefully be off-model to exaggerate the
acting in the scene.

<li><p><strong>Designing a New Character</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Research and discovery</li>
<li>Step 2: Hone in on your character's traits</li>
<li>Step 3: Do lots of sketching</li>
<li>Step 4: Finalize your character design drawing (begin with a front
view or 3/4 view)</li>
<li>Step 5: Create the full rotation for the turn-around views</li>
<li>Step 6: Develop some rough poses and expressions</li>
<li>Step 7: Get feedback</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Strategies on your Approach</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Personality!</li>
<li>Visual Interest!</li>
<li>Simplicity &amp; Recognizability - Add details and complexity later,
if needed</li>
<li>Avoid Clichés - Unless that’s the intention</li>
<li>Know The Character’s Story - Where does a character begin, where
does it end, and what does it do in-between?</li>
<li>In the beginning, when you’re only exploring concepts; draw more
loose, rough, and fast - create lots of thumbnails!</li>
<li>Shape &amp; Form - Consider how the character's shapes work in three
dimensions and how they look from different angles, while you are
searching for that character of yours, play around with hair/fur styles,
various attitudes/postures and costumes/outfits &gt; Afterwards, think
about detailing &amp; surfacing - are textures, shading or shadows
needed?</li>
<li>What is the character’s linework? - Is it thick or thin, tapered or
varied, bumpy or textured, colored lines or perhaps no lines at
all!</li>
<li>Paint - Explore color options (if required), use color to
differentiate personalities, highlight features and create contrast &gt;
Color can also convey a character's mood, attitude, and role in the
story!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Things To Keep in Mind</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[✓] Appeal/Believability: Balance originality and familiarity.
Create visually appealing silhouettes. Consider how the character's
design reflects their role and personality traits. For example, iconic
characters like Homer Simpson, Mickey Mouse, and Mario have simple yet
recognizable designs.</li>
<li>[✓] Use References Effectively: Research distinctive styles. Try out
a range of possibilities, then repeat and experiment. Seek out and
incorporate feedback from others you trust.</li>
<li>[✓] Uniqueness: Make your character visually distinct and easily
recognizable by incorporating symbolic or iconic elements.</li>
<li>[✓] Audience: Consider what will make your character appealing and
believable to your demographic.</li>
<li>[✓] Backstory: Give your character some history, personality, and
motivations that help explain how they look; torn jeans, makeup, scars,
braces, hunched back, messy hair, a cane, an eyepatch, an arm cast -
things that could add story to their disposition and individuality.

<p>In terms of timespan; you can hit these 12 assignments full-time and
expect to complete them all in roughly 30 to 60 hours total -- Depending
on research-time and personal speed, your results may vary. This was
originally created as part of an animation program where students would
spend 3-6 hours per week, executing each assignment as homework.</p>
<p>The hours increase as the requirements &amp; parameters go up in the
later assignments - in which case, picking away at these exercises and
completing all assignments within 10 weeks at a very casual pace is
often the preferred approach. But this could be all done within just a 1
to 3 weeks at a more steady and dedicated pace, this includes reading,
watching, listening to all external links and supplementary materials.
So don’t be concerned about your output, go at your own speed, and
produce the best work you can.</p>
<p>You may use the designs you create from these assignments for your
portfolio, while citing credit to the original studio/artist ---
Example: ©Disney ©WB ©Matt Groening</p>
<hr />
<p>The Assignments outlined below are to create a NEW character within a
chosen established style from an existing series/film.</p>
<p>There are many more specific aspects of character design methods and
theories to apply to your work within the rest of these chapters - you
will see these with each Assignment, as they gradually cover more
principles and techniques with tutorials and advice on various
subjects.</p>
<p>You will notice a wide range of design aesthetics to learn from, and
some visual guides showing you how to explore these design styles even
further. So far, this document (and the many links provided) display a
solid starting ground, which can help inform your decisions in the early
stages of the development for your character design process. There’s a
few more technical things to be aware of, and you’ll see them as you go
through these series of practice exercises. There’s lots more links and

<p>By Adem Kaan</p>
<p>Advice from Andy Ristain, lead designer on <em>Adventure
Time</em>:</p>
<p>Developing an understanding of how to construct a successful
character design, and bringing together the components required to
execute it commercially, are hard-won skills. But with this expertise
comes a wealth of opportunity for those with the passion, drive and
imagination to pursue it.</p>
<p>The goal of a character designer is to make the main characters as
appealing as possible in as simple a way as possible.</p>
<p>A cartoon about the last human boy, Finn, and a shape-changing dog
named Jake, Adventure Time follows their journey in a post-apocalyptic
world called Ooo. I think that challenge is what attracted me to
character design.</p>
<p>The cast of characters from the Adventure Time series, featuring the
main protagonists Finn and Jake, was originally created for a younger
audience, but the series has grown and matured into a cultural
phenomenon that appeals to adults and children alike. The show has
continuity and the actions and decisions the characters make have
lasting repercussions.</p>
<p>To become truly great at crafting characters, illustrators need to
invest the time in developing their own visual language at the most
basic level – by drawing every day. Taking inspiration from nature and
his surroundings, mastering character design is a process that can't be
rushed.</p>
<p>If you're building a family of characters, it can help to create a
set of rules that define their graphical elements, before then
experimenting with size and proportion. And try to think in three
dimensions, draw a character and consider how it would look from the
side, back and front – not just flat on the screen.</p>
<p>For budding character designers, I have three key tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with shape and form</li>
<li>Take the time to let your mind wonder</li>
<li>Keep drawing</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It takes time, practice, effort and a lot of exploration, but if you
keep digging you'll eventually find a place that's totally your
own.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Samples of this design style:</p>

src="./images/unnamed_1086.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_891.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Doing clean lines and colors are completely optional at this stage,
later assignments explore color.</p>

src="./images/unnamed_1227.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Clean- up and color pass is encouraged, but ALWAYS optional for these
exercises. These are intended to be more black-and-white, line art only.
Later on, color becomes compulsory for a select few exercises, for now
tight roughs like these for a turnaround sheet is all you need.</p>

Characters</h3>
<p>The secret to being a versatile character designer is to absorb the
knowledge from as many artists as possible and filter-in the aspects
that speak true to you. Take your time, watch and listen to the video
essays provided below here, and in all the chapters from all the
following Assignments. Remember and apply the aspects that make most
sense to you. But be open to everything, various styles and techniques
are explored and displayed. These are just to get you in the proper
mindset, they explore an assortment of different principles, methods,

<p>Valerio Fabbretti was the art director for <em>The Fungies!</em>
animated series and Becky Dreisdadt who worked as the character
supervisor for <em>Adventure Time: Distant Lands</em>, have gone over
the process together involved in a typical cartoon character design and
how to build a portfolio focused on this aspect, these are portions from
a webinar they had hosted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CHARACTER DESIGN FOR AN ANIMATED SERIES</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_479.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In terms of character design, Becky comments that it is important to
know how to draw in a great variety of angles. Depending on the
relevance of each character, it may even be necessary to include
additional information and sketches. That’s why it’s better that you are
deeply familiarized with each character, in case you ever need to bring
up more details about them as needed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1366.jpg" alt="Cartoon Character Design" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cartoon Character Design</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Either way, with every character that you work on you need to create
a register on how the mouth moves when making sounds or speaking. This
is of great help to the animators when they need to work on scenes where
there are dialogues. Of equal importance is to draw the characters with
different expressions on their faces, for example, when they are happy,
sad, scared or angry.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_166.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And although it is something not done frequently, Becky admits that
one of the most difficult tasks in character design is to draw scenes
where there are crowds involved. You need to know not only which
characters are going to be in the crowd, but also how many of them will
be and how to draw them together but in a way that each one is easily
distinguishable. Of course, you need to avoid making tangent lines. This
can be difficult while working in a unique character design and even
more so where there are multiple ones in a crowd. If this isn’t hard
enough, you also need to be able to draw the crowds as seen from
different angles.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_552.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1311.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Sometimes you also need to modify a character design that’s already
established. This can be either because it needs a new costume,
accessories or to show some battle damage in their attire. In this case,
you need to follow the references provided by the artist that made the
original design, but you are also free to take your own approach and
give it some of your personal style. This way you can come up with new
and exciting versions of a character design.</p>

<p>When a team of artists gets a new storyboard, Valerio explains that
they first analyze it to find if there are any new characters or
elements that need to be designed for the episode. After taking note of
any new designs that need to be done, he assigns them to each artist
taking in consideration their strengths and weaknesses, as well as what
they tend to like drawing more.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1176.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Being the art director, Valerio is responsible for making sure that
each character design stays true to the show creator’s vision. Not only
does he supervise the design process for the characters, but also the
way color is applied on them and finally, the way they are animated.
After all, it’s his job to make sure that there aren’t any errors and
that the final art is top notch.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1233.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_384.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>As for Becky, being a character supervisor, she is also deeply
involved in this process. She is in charge of supervising her team of
artists specializing in character design, as well as reporting back to
the art director. One of her tasks is also making a guide of rules and
important elements that every artist on her team must follow while
creating a character design.</p>
<p>This can be like the way eyes should be drawn, the proportions that
must be considered, general mistakes to avoid and so on. This in turn
helps to decrease the times a design needs to be corrected, speeding up
the process of working on each one of them. Also she is the one
responsible for creating the designs for the major characters in each
episode.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THINGS YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_019.jpg" alt="Cartoon Character Design" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cartoon Character Design</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Valerio says that one of the most important things is to know about
anatomy. That’s why he is so keen on observing if an artist is capable
of drawing eyes, hands and feets. In his opinion, this is an indication
that the artist knows about anatomic proportions, thereforth is easily
able to adapt to different art styles while maintaining the correct
proportions.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_712.png" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_914.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>It’s also vital to know about perspective, because as a character
design artist, you need to be able to draw in a wide range of angles
while giving a sense of depth in your work. Becky, on the other hand,
says that it’s fundamental to know about storytelling. That is why she
prefers portfolios that show some experience or at least understanding
in storyboards and comics. Of course, authenticity is greatly
appreciated, so you need to include mostly designs for original
characters that you created.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_942.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>How about showing off that you are proficient in drawing multiple art
styles? If you are really great at it, then go for it. But it’s not
necessary in Valerio’s opinion. He says he prefers seeing an artist with
a unique style in which he truly is good at. After all, if you are
talented enough at drawing and understand about anatomic proportions,
you can learn the art style for a series over time. Becky agrees with
this statement, saying it’s preferable to show consistency and mastery
of one art style than regular or poor abilities in multiple ones. But if
you’re sticking to one style (your own personal style), then make sure
it’s appealing and consistent.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_401.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When including your character designs, you must show them not only in
static poses but in movement also. A good artist is capable of showing
some of their character’s personality through movement, and that’s why
Valerio says he values a portfolio where he can see characters with more
dynamic poses.</p>
<p>And while a finished character design is the most valued work in a
portfolio, you also need to show the creative process behind it. Valerio
comments it’s helpful to include at least some quick and rough sketches,
so a recruiter can see your ability in cleaning up lines and strokes.
Finally, this may seem obvious but Becky states that you need to include
colored works of art. While it is true that most character design
artists only need to work in grayscale or monochromatic schemes,
including some colored pieces can make your portfolio look more visually
appealing.</p>

This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing

no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them. This

<blockquote>
<p>Practical Character Design Tips from the Etherington Brothers:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All character designs, no matter how complex they seem, can be broken
down into a set of simple shapes. The more through lines there are from
one shape to another, the better the shapes combine as a single form.
Bold silhouettes come from a symbiotic combination of shapes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_787.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To expand upon the three basic shapes of Round, Box, Triangle - there
are these 7 shapes you need to design any character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_957.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you can draw these shapes, you can draw anything.</p>
<p>There can be squashed and stretched variations of these as well, but
these are the main ones used for all foundations of character design.
The less shapes at the core of your design, the more iconic it
becomes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_266.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Building your design around a primary and secondary shape is very
effective.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1200.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Primary / Secondary can be applied to the face as well.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_168.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using one shape in multiple positions and angles allows a more
complex design to remain visually balanced.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_301.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sometimes combining shapes inharmoniously can work well.</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1428.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_535.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>☝️ You can see how these design principles apply to backgrounds and
scenery as well ☝️</p>
<p><strong>Dividing Characters into 3 Sections</strong>.</p>
<p>A great approach for designing a wide range of distinctive characters
is to divide them up into three sections.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1023.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol type="1">
<li>Begin by randomly choosing the height of each section as either
short, medium or tall.
<ul>
<li><figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_430.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next, randomly make the width of each section narrow, medium, or
wide.
<ul>
<li><figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_121.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we just draw these as standing boxes we can already see the range
of body proportions.
<ul>
<li><figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_315.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Connect the shapes using either curved or angled lines.
<ul>
<li><figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1101.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ul></li>
<li>With your proportions in place, draw small thumbnail sketches of
characters within them. Try lots of designs for each shape, it always
works!
<ul>

</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The 3-shape approach is so effective, you can use it to take one
character and generate endless variations! Let’s start with this simple
robot…</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1414.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There’s no end to the options, just change the width and height of
the three sections!</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1422.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Although the 3-shape process is just one of many approaches to
character design.</p>
<p>It also helps you to better analyze other characters’
proportions.</p>

main volume around different areas.</p>

<h3 id="proportions">Proportions</h3>
<p>When it comes to a character's age in comparison to their head size -
it can become quite arbitrary and puzzling. When examining proportions
and their relationship to a character’s age - it's all contextual and
relative to the universe they reside in. For example, what do all these
male cartoon characters have in common?</p>

age from a line-up?</p>

<p>How design choices are made, like height and face shape, is all about
the surrounding characters and environment.</p>
<p>Their age is easier to specify by comparison.</p>

<p>Another fun way to compare proportions is to match the character

<p>Why Batman The Animated Series Changed its Character Designs -
Writer, Paul Dini Explains the Controversy:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Few adaptations are as beloved as Batman: The Animated Series,
however, the series' decision to update character designs in between its
original run and The New Batman Adventures is one aspect that did not
sit right with fans. Timmverse legend and Harley Quinn co-creator Paul
Dini has revealed what led to the polarizing changes.</p>
<p>"I think that was all from the desires of [BTAS co-creator] Bruce
Timm and the other artists and directors to vary the look of the
characters somewhat between iterations," Dini explains. "Partially it
was to make it look a little more like the new look of the Superman
animated series, but also to just experiment and refine a few
things."</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_406.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some of the design changes were warmly received by fans, such as the
choice to have an older version of Dick Grayson portraying his popular
alter ego Nightwing, and giving Scarecrow a creepy new visage that even
included a frayed noose around his neck. Others, though, didn't go over
as well. Specifically, the choices to give Joker hollowed-out, black
eyes, Catwoman abnormally chalky skin, and Bane's new mask left some
fans cold.</p>
<p>Being a veteran of the industry since the 1980s, Dini found the fan
reaction to the design changes a bit odd, especially given that
character refining has been a common practice in animation for decades.
"That tradition of visual reinvention has always been a part of Warner
Bros Animation," Dini stated. "No one ever asks about Bugs Bunny and
Daffy Duck getting visually redefined over the years, it was just
something the directors did over time."</p>
<p>There is also a commercial reason for animation studios to change the
look of their characters. Given that the majority of revenue surrounding
animation properties comes from merchandising rights for toys, new
designs give companies new editions to place on store shelves.</p>
<p>Starring Kevin Conroy, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Mark Hamill, Batman:
The Animated Series debuted in 1992, and stands as one of the most
acclaimed adaptations of comic books to another medium. The series won
four Emmy Awards and ran from 1992 to 1995, with follow-up series The
New Batman Adventures airing from 1997 to 1999, for a total of 109
episodes.</p>

<h3 id="contrasting-shapes">Contrasting Shapes</h3>
<p>One vastly important aspect of all design is Contrast - it improves
your character art by providing the viewer with two (or more) things
that play off one another, simply by being different.</p>
<p><em>Contrast = Interest</em>.</p>
<p>This applies to almost every aspect of art, but it’s especially
important when we dive into character design.</p>

<p>Unique Shapes + Contrast in Individual Characters:</p>
<p>Designing characters around base shapes for contrast and appeal is a
time-tested tradition among animators and illustrators.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1228.jpg" alt="Po_Kung_Fu_Panda" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Po_Kung_Fu_Panda</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Take a look at this image of Po, for a few great examples. First, his
color scheme is classic contrast: Black and white. There is no greater
contrast than these opposing forces. Look deeper into his design and
you’ll see a myriad of contrast from shape. As you can see, the design
of the pose itself is a factor in the appeal and clarity of the
character and its attitude.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1392.png" alt="po_shapes" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">po_shapes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>He is made up of many circles overall, all these elements work
together to create a visually interesting character. If he was made
entirely of one shape it would not be nearly as interesting. Yet at the
same time, there is an overall form to adhere to rather than placing
things sporadically or randomly. His overall pose is a triangle, which
you’ll see repeated in many of the promo images and poses Dreamworks
puts the character in. Everything about his design speaks of
<strong>heavy</strong>, <strong>friendly</strong>,
<strong>solid</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Unique Shapes + Contrast in a Cast of
Characters</strong>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t stop there, though! Not only should characters have
contrast in their individual designs, there should be contrast among the
whole cast!</p>

<p>These rough drawings from the Aladdin sheet are a perfect example.
You see the characters each have a variety of base shapes showing how
they contrast nicely against each other. Providing a lot of visual
interest, appeal, individuality, and insight on each character’s core
personalities.</p>
<p>In a cast of characters, you want to work with contrasting and
complementary shapes:</p>

<p>No matter what the show style may be, aim for variety. People come in
all shapes and sizes, body type variations are more clear when you
silhouette them.</p>

<p>Here’s designs for incidental background characters from the series
<em>Mike Tyson Mysteries</em>. This is just an example showing how
various body types and costuming needs to be constructed to populate the
world your cast of characters will reside in, notice how variations on
similar body types, assortment of costumes, a diversity of head shapes,
and subtle differences in proportions are used:</p>

<p>When studying how to re-create any particular design style, discover
and analyze the structure of the anatomy. For example, Kim Possible
follows this design language:</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1369.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s not only the pattern of shapes that make up the body parts, but
the characters’ graphic style as a whole. Practice with really loose and
quick roughs, to figure out the forms, arrangement of <a

and what techniques are needed to adapt your drawings to the intended
design style.</p>
<p>For Kim Possible style:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_851.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1471.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_142.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1342.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Vary your shapes and proportions:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_864.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_593.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Vary the size and shape, using Exclamation Points!</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_034.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The exclamation point method is a great construction tool to block in
shapes effectively and easily, it can work well on detailed anatomy but
most commonly seen in more graphically represented characters like
these. The exclamation point represents the ribs and pelvis.</p>

<p>Although the Simpsons characters and their appearances have become a
familiar part of our everyday lives now, it’s not hard to imagine that
it must have taken people quite a bit of time to get used to, when these
characters first came on-air with their bright yellow skin tone. The
Simpsons creator Matt Groening has spoken about what it felt like to
finally arrive at a decision, as he was choosing his characters’ skin
color.</p>
<p>Apparently, Groening’s main motivation was simple: He wanted to make
the Springfield residents look memorable and interesting. With all of
the other animated series on the air, Groening felt it was important to
make sure that Homer, as well as his family and neighbors, stood out
from the crowd. Although he considered other colors, yellow was the one
that shone through in the end.</p>
<p>“This is the answer! When you’re flicking through channels, and a
flash of yellow goes by, you’ll know you’re watching The Simpsons,”
Groening once stated.</p>
<h3 id="character-dimension">Character Dimension</h3>
<p>Advice from <a
href="https://www.samnielson.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865336676&amp;usg=AOvVaw3b9lLBsCJ7d_zemykfc4Im">Sam
Nielson</a>:</p>
<p>Character dimension is a concept I’ve found very useful when striving
for more appealing character designs. I’m not talking about the literal
dimension of forms, but how to give the characters the appropriate
amount of personality and interest relative to their screen time in the
story. There are a lot of theories on this, so I’m picking the pieces
from those theories that best apply to character design.</p>
<p>This idea of character dimension is best explained with contrast.
There are four different levels of dimension as it relates to visual
design, with the highest level being a three-dimensional character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_656.jpg"
alt="Characterdimension_BitDiagram.jpg" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">Characterdimension_BitDiagram.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first level of depth is a “bit” character. Think of a bit as a
single point in space, with no dimension. A bit character displays only
one character attribute—usually meant to fulfill a single purpose as
that character stands in the spotlight onscreen for a very brief time.
Here’s an example of a bit part: the hopelessly nerdy character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_065.jpg"
alt="SamNielson_Characterdimension_Bit.jpg" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">SamNielson_Characterdimension_Bit.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To keep this character aligned with that bit part, I tried to make
everything on him give a “sad sack” feeling—droopy, soft, and
ineffective. This character is understood in his entirety almost
immediately, which makes him useful for brief moments with no
introduction. A character like this can still act against type in that
instant, but that action must be understood quickly in context of that
simple and clear character bit, or the contrasting attributes will only
create confusion. The weakness of a bit character is that after this
character serves his momentary purpose, he will become insufficiently
interesting* for extra time in the spotlight.</p>
<p>(*As a side note, I should mention that any character design can be
enriched through great writing and animation. Appealing and appropriate
characters can make great writing and animation better, but even the
best character design will struggle without the other two.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_344.jpg"
alt="Characterdimension_1Diagram.jpg" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">Characterdimension_1Diagram.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Imagine taking that single point in space, that surface character
attribute, and stretching it into a line. Now you have two poles
possible with contrasting components, or a one-dimensional character.
The contrasting attributes here are different from a bit character
acting against type, because this character may be seen at varying
points along that line throughout the film (while a bit character acting
against type will always act the same). My example of a one-dimensional
character adds aggressive confidence to a hopelessly nerdy
character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_524.jpg"
alt="SamNielson_Characterdimension_1.jpg" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">SamNielson_Characterdimension_1.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I communicated the two poles of this character’s single dimension by
contrasting gesture, expression, and shape language against his easily
understood role or type. You can also do this with contrasting costume
decisions, color scheme, and other elements. Usually, the
one-dimensional character is defined by “what,” meaning both poles are
expressions of how that character fills his role in the world.
One-dimensional characters remain interesting for longer, and they can
even have simple character arcs, but they lack any real depth.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_480.jpg"
alt="Characterdimension_2Diagram.jpg" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">Characterdimension_2Diagram.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Adding one more dimension to a character creates depth and a lot more
interest. This second dimension is usually defined by “why?”, or the
character’s history and motivations. Expanding on the example character,
who now has one dimension that goes between hopelessly nerdy all the way
to confident villain, but also adds a second dimension that shows a
little bit of the inner demons driving him; a life of bullying and
misfortune.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_839.jpg" alt="Characterdimension_2.jpg" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Characterdimension_2.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this case I imagined the opposing poles of his second dimension
are his need to be someone—to have power over his life, contrasted with
his complete helplessness in the context of the strength and
socially-driven world he has always lived in. I used recent
fight-related injuries and the expression to suggest the character’s
history and the hardening of his motivations. Typically, the visual
language for history and motivation is going to be a second read,
meaning that the first dimension is the first stuff the audience sees,
but is then modified with a closer look at the character. A character
with this much complexity needs enough screen time to show all
combinations of the four extremes of these two dimensions; otherwise he
collapses down to a one-dimensional character in the story, in which
case the audience will feel dissatisfaction and an intuitive need to
know more about him than his screen time allows, because of the amount
of conflict the character suggests. That said, even if I’m designing a
one-dimensional character, I will often explore the second dimension
story-wise because understanding the backstory and inner demons can
suggest interesting expressions of that single dimension that I wouldn’t
have thought of otherwise.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_487.jpg"
alt="Characterdimension_3Diagram.jpg" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">Characterdimension_3Diagram.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The third dimension is the “who” of the character; and it is the
hardest one to quantify in the visual parts of the character design.
This dimension demands a lot of screen time, as the character now needs
to go through the hero’s journey. A protagonist, the love interest, a
sidekick, or even the main villain can be three-dimensional, so long as
there’s enough time to unravel all three dimensions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1192.jpg"
alt="SamNielson_Characterdimension_3.jpg" />
<figcaption
aria-hidden="true">SamNielson_Characterdimension_3.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This character starts the story being defined by WHAT he is (the
hopelessly nerdy kid bordering on supervillainy), then the story would
explore WHY he has become that way (inner demons of social and physical
abuse by peers he wants to impress), but to gain the third dimension,
then the story must test the limits of that character beyond the surface
attributes and internal desires or motivations. In other words, you
can’t know WHO this character is until you have seen the things that
outwardly define him stripped away, and see the choices he makes when
facing the resulting desolation of his failure. In visual design terms,
you cannot show this journey all at once! But you can show the potential
for that character to change. More nuance in shape language, a little
baby face bias, more thoughtful, vulnerable eyes, and even a less “set”
demeanor can help cue the audience that this character is not yet done
with his journey. Unlike previous dimensions, you can sometimes apply
three-dimensional design to a character in a two-dimensional role
without frustrating the audience; so long as the suggestion of
potential-for-change doesn’t compete with the role the character plays
in the story.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have a character with more dimensions than this?
Yes; even four and five-dimensional characters can work in a story, but
fitting that extra information into a design is very difficult! My
experience is that the first and second dimensions can be layered into a
character after the initial design, so your design process doesn’t need
to include all this information from the start, so long as you can get
your art director to be patient with the exploration of those
dimensions. Character dimension is less about which is good, better, or
best; and more about designing characters that are appropriate for their
roles in the story. I hope this proves to be a helpful tool to other
aspiring character designers out there!</p>

<p>How to do a Gesture drawing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Observe the pose for 10 seconds</p></li>
<li><p>Try to find the main idea/feeling of the pose</p></li>
<li><p>Grab a loose basic drawing or a small thumbnail</p></li>
<li><p>Push that pose</p></li>
<li><p>No one will know you changed it!</p></li>
<li><p>Emphasize the pose, don’t always make it dynamic</p></li>
<li><p>Use the model as a jumping off point</p></li>
<li><p>Go with your first impression - follow your instincts</p></li>

<p>Grab artwork or photos from online, or pause on videos, take a
screenshot - bring it into your drawing software and DRAW OVER it to
FIND the structure, it can be fun and a great learning experience:</p>

<p>Doing a character study like these can help you see where the
patterns are in the anatomy that is unique to that property’s style,
here’s an example of a breakdown of the various shapes, proportions and
body types from Total Drama Island:</p>

<p>Structural anatomy is one of the most basic and important aspects to
learn about character design - it can be broken down many different
ways, here’s just a few examples:</p>

<p>Your drawing skills, your drawing speed, and your work ethic, are
your primary tools that will make you a valued employee in the field of
character design. Creativity and Style develop naturally and slowly over
time. Your level of draftsmanship in figure drawing is something you
will work on during your entire career. Even though you’ll never
directly use the practice drawings you do with figure drawing in your
work, the underlying skills it develops will increase your knowledge and
abilities when it comes to design.</p>

<p>*For this assignment, it’s time to get really in-depth with a full
character design pack. Produce <strong>1 new character</strong> in the
relevant visual style that would fit in that universe. Create a
<strong><em>comprehensive 12-page</em></strong> model pack, with a
10-point turnaround showcasing your process going into full detail, see
below for instructions. This is for you to explore the procedure of
completing a deep dive on a character pack that would go to a builds
artist to use to create the final character setup for animation
purposes. This is all about creating a new and comprehensive main
character that would be production-ready like you would see in a
professional character pack, including sheets that show your process and
initial visual development.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here is an extended wrap-up to this crash course, with lots more info
on how to get ready, how to continue with your training, how to branch
off into other aspects of this industry, and how to proceed with seeking
out employment in character design. This covers the many avenues for you
to choose from and expand upon, how to continue on your journey to
improve further, and what to expect as you get into this field.</p>

<h3 id="advice-for-the-aspiring-character-designer">Advice for the
Aspiring Character Designer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice Turn Arounds</strong>
<ul>
<li>Because turns are so important to the TV animation <a
href="https://youtu.be/BO7IaOW-8kE&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865384072&amp;usg=AOvVaw2tokit8D8FdrUICJHE6K_u">pipeline</a>,
knowing how to rotate a character properly is essential in showing off
your skills and how to be useful in the design team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be Familiar with Mouth Charts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Less integral than turns since most shows teach you their in-house
system for mouth charts, but researching what the standard mouth shapes
are and memorizing them is a good way to prepare, this way you only need
to adapt them to the style you will be doing them for.</li>
<li><figure>

</figure></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Draw Animals</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nothing really shows your draftsmanship skills quite like drawing a
horse or giraffe. Practice drawing animals because inevitably, there
will be a time when you have to draw one as a character designer. See if
you can stylize animal anatomy in different ways.</li>

<li>By Ben Balistreri</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hoard Images</strong>
<ul>
<li>Professional character designers usually have massive collections of
photo references of things that inspire them. Save photos of outfits,
hairdos, people, poses, images of models sheets and sketches from
various artists and styles -- Anything that sparks your imagination.
Keep them organized in lots of folders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Keep your Layers Organized</strong>
<ul>
<li>In TV animation, one Photoshop file is passed from artist to artist
through the pipeline so a messy layering/labeling system can be a
nightmare for whoever touches your file next. Always strive to be
organized when setting up your photoshop files so that you are kind to
whoever has to deal with it next.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Work on Speed</strong>
<ul>
<li>The entire character design industry can be summed up in 4 words:
<strong>GOOD DESIGNS, ON TIME</strong></li>
<li>This is NEVER easy. The demand for quality and quantity on a
relentless deadline-based weekly schedule, will ALWAYS be challenging.
Practice managing your time, and try different techniques and tools to
help you stay focused and on track. Practice drawing more efficiently,
work on saving sites and resources that are fast to use to have at your
fingertips for searching for references. Organize your own folders of
saved imagery and website links archived and easy to access.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stay Healthy</strong>
<ul>
<li>Here is a document about how to prevent repetitive stress disorder
and other injuries that can happen from drawing for too many hours, and
how to prevent harm to your body from working at a computer for long
periods of time. It comes with some advice on exercising, nutrition,
sleep, and how to manage burn-out: <a

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Just Keep on Drawing</strong>
<ul>
<li>More than other positions in TV animation, a character designer
needs to really know how to DRAW. To what level of draftsmanship? This
depends on the type of show, but being a strong illustrator with a wide
array of skillsets will only make you a more desirable character artist…
and will ultimately help you maintain longevity in your career. Stay
motivated, start doing the work, become focused, don’t overthink
everything, choose action over everything else, <a

<blockquote>
<p>“When you just grab the instrument, keyboard, or pen, you just need
to start, just do something, anything, you’ll realize it happens almost
by itself, you become the conduit for that creative energy that was
waiting to flow out. You keep your ego out of it, it happens on its own,
it just will pour out of you, but you need to get started first. When it
comes to art, you can’t wait to be ready, you can’t tell yourself you’re
not prepared and not ready to start, you just need to start, right away,
no matter what.” - Robert Rodriguez</p>

<li><strong>How to be more efficient:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drawing</strong> - Develop your drawing skills to create
compelling visuals and show off the various styles you can do</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong> - Find and collect references from all
types of sources to find inspiration</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Understand how your characters fit
into the narrative and how they relate to each other</li>
<li><strong>Digital tools</strong> - Practice on the software;
Photoshop, Illustrator, Clip Studio Paint and Procreate</li>

<h3 id="build-your-portfolio">Build Your Portfolio</h3>
<p>Strong character design portfolios usually have some key
features:</p>
<p>Show you have a range of styles - especially in TV animation, chances
are you will need to bounce between several different types of shows
with different styles.</p>
<p>A good way to show your breadth as a designer is to have 3 vastly
different styles at the top of your portfolio.</p>
<p>For Example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Your personal style/comfort zone</li>
<li>Super cartoony/simplified/stylized</li>
<li>Very anatomically-accurate/realistic</li>
</ol>
<p>TV animation has designers who know how to become chameleons. A good
strategy for showcasing your design chops is to create one main project
in your comfort zone style. Showcase your handle on Emotion and
Storytelling and Draftsmanship by using a pre-existing property and
create a new character in your own native style. Create character
lineups, poses, expressions, vignettes and scenarios, showing their
personalities and how they interact.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_536.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Consider showing your preliminary sketches and explorations of
different potential takes of a character. The other 2 styles (super
cartoony and realistic/anatomical) don’t need to be of the same project,
just nice lineups of characters to show you can switch styles readily.
The specific design languages don’t matter, those are just choices to
make and to stick to for the specific personality and intentions behind
the character’s design.</p>
<p>Practice your techniques to adjust your drawing style to suit various
shows: <a
href="https://youtu.be/g1jggviRYME?t%3D97&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865391167&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VcgVo6hNNbtLlsczVvODm">Inspire
Multiple Designs From One Idea</a></p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_759.png" alt="image" /> <img

<p>For one or two characters in your portfolio - show your progression
stages, employers like to see your thought process:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_620.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_834.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>There’s no one correct way to present your characters in your
portfolio, only some principles to follow to make your designs clear in
your layouts to make things visually appealing. When thinking about how
to present your characters, follow the patterns other designers take -
keep it simple and inviting. A common way of displaying your work is to
combine the turnarounds with head angles/expressions and a full-figure
pose off to the side like this:</p>

or any other free portfolio-making site of your choice. There's dozens
to choose from, they all do the same thing, research through them, find
the one that you like best, and sign up for it. What you'll do with it
is very simple: you don't need anything fancy; you're just displaying
your work, and it’s good to show some versions with your exploration
sketches, rough pass, clean lineart and some color. The important thing
is to have your <strong>contact info</strong> visible everywhere, to
keep your site simple, easy-to-navigate, and only having your very
<strong>best work</strong> on display.</p>
<p>Have at least 10 different character design turnarounds (4pt, or
more) in your portfolio. Show some variety in your progress and design
packs: rough explorations with clean or colored works, only show your
very best. Showing your process helps employers see what your thoughts
are while creating and they always appreciate that.</p>

<p>View these portfolios as solid examples of what YOU can achieve after
a few years of experience! It’s easy to be intimidated by the refined
styles of these pro illustrators and designers and the sleek layout of
their portfolios -- These high standards take years to slowly build up
and achieve. But remember: the quality of your designs will depend on
the time you spent on them and how much research and preparation you’ve
done beforehand. If you are worried about having no production
experience -- it still truly doesn’t matter…</p>
<p>Your portfolio is meant to display your vast potential to your
employers. If you DO have experience, then your résumé (LinkedIn) can
show off your list of jobs and skill sets, along with listings of what
productions you’ve worked on in the past, including any personal
projects and courses you’ve taken, no matter how small the tasks and
work you’ve done, include EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>Your portfolio site should always be focused on keeping the very best
of your designs on display. Always think about clear and simple page
layouts, and indicate you are more than willing to receive and complete
their design tests when submitting your applications. Your skills, your
dedication, and work ethic will ALWAYS matter most to employers.</p>
<p>If you’re showcasing samples of your character designs created from
the exercises off this site or just your own original creations (or a
bit of both), know that your portfolio site is primarily there to
present your diversity in the styles you are capable of producing and
the potential you have at being a solid worker. Your portfolio needs to
show your range as an artist, keep things simple and straight-forward,
remember, the bigger range of different styles you show, the more
employable it will make you, but only show your most high quality
work.</p>

<p>If you happen to be humble, timid, stoic, shy, soft spoken,
introverted, or nervous -- that’s totally fine! A studio head, talent
recruiter, employer, director, or producer will always want you more for
your skills, ideas, resourcefulness, creativity and artistic abilities
above all else. Be aware of the fact that the odds of anyone stumbling
upon your portfolio by random chance are very, very slim. You need to
reach out to studios, their talent recruitment person, HR person, line
producer, operations manager, whoever it may be, and give them the link
to your work and ask if they have a test for you to complete, or any
jobs you could do for them.</p>

<p>Skill and methodology evolves over time, be patient. Know that
everyone draws, sketches and designs differently and in their own way.
Even with a short résumé and little-to-no experience &gt; don’t be
discouraged! You can apply for other types of design work within the <a

pipeline</a> to get started and to get your experience points built up;
Prop Designer, Character Clean-up Artist, Character Design Assistant, or
Design Revisionist are just some of the alternatives and common
first-jobs you can get in the design department of an animation studio.
Ask them about how to start off as a junior artist or a design intern -
they’re all excellent ways to get your foot-in-the-door, it’s all about
how to get your start, convince them to give you a chance, to complete
some tests to show your skills or to have you on a short internship. See

for those wanting to break into video game design.</p>
<p>Then it’s your responsibility to do the best work you can as fast as
you can, show them you have some potential to grow, learn, to be helpful
and useful to their design team at the very least. While you are waiting
for work, keep drawing and keep adding to your portfolio!</p>

<p>To add a bit of variety in your portfolio you can create casts of
characters as a group together…</p>
<p>Try this! &gt; Design a family portrait: <strong>6
characters</strong> (full body) - Mother, Father, Daughter, Son,
Grandmother, and house Pet (dog, cat, iguana, or anything). Choices in
their attitudes/expressions will help to define their moods in this
moment. Are they all happy, sad, angry, bored? A mixture of all these?
Their hair and clothing choices are important in depicting what type of
family they are and what time period they may be from. Pose them as a
group together. Have fun with it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1270.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>

<p>For extra effort, add more family members, and in color!</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Try this! &gt; Design a classroom of kids: Pick any design style
you’re most comfortable with, and create a school classroom group photo,
showcasing <strong>16 characters</strong> of 2nd grade kids. This will
have you think about what their distinctly unique personalities,
clothing, hairstyles, postures and expressions are.</p>

<p>Try this! &gt; Design a group from a fantasy roleplaying adventure
game: <strong>4 characters</strong> - a Barbarian, a Thief (Rogue), a
Wizard (Sorcerer), and a Warrior (Fighter). Add more if you wish, like a
Bard, a Knight, a Ranger, a Cleric, or a Monk. Pose them together as a
team.</p>

<p>Color and texture is not necessary, but a welcome bonus.</p>

<p>Including pieces like these add originality to your portfolio!</p>
<p>Exploring how your character would look at various ages can help you
discover certain aspects about them and have you see your character in a
different way, which can help your visual development process for your
personal work. A nice exercise to produce for your portfolio would be to
pick ANY one character, from your own creation or not, and re-draw them
at <strong>various ages</strong>. As an example - showing them as a
baby, toddler, child, teenager, adult, older adult and elder. This can
be a great 7-stage progression of character designs to showcase:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_060.jpg" alt="image" /> <img
src="./images/unnamed_1404.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Suggested ages you could draw the same character at: 1, 5, 10, 16,
30, 60, 90</p>
<h4 id="when-can-you-update-your-portfolio-with-your-new-work">When can
you update your portfolio with your new work?</h4>
<p>The question is often raised about WHEN should you post the designs
in your portfolio you’ve made for a client or studio?</p>
<p>You’ve worked on a contract for a few months, the production has come
to an end, but there’s still many months, possibly over a year before
the designs you’ve made are animated, completed, and broadcast/streamed
to the public.</p>
<p>In nearly ALL cases, executives and studios do not allow the release
of any visual material (online or anywhere) before all the episodes have
come out. Therefore, unfortunately you cannot post your work in a
portfolio update or social media posts until the animated property has
been released. Afterwards you’re good to publish your work and update
the online portfolio.</p>
<p>For your own personal projects and characters of your own creation,
of course, update your portfolio with these as soon as you can.</p>
<h4 id="copyrights">Copyrights</h4>
<p>To dispel any myths about the dangers of copyright laws for what you
are permitted to place in your portfolio - here's a breakdown of the two
possible scenarios...</p>
<p>This is YOUR own drawings of a new character in a few
<strong>established styles</strong> from four different animated
series:</p>

<p>You can see how there’s many similarities for what studios are
looking for in an artist. You might also see employers asking for 2, 3,
or 5+ years of experience, but you should STILL APPLY, no matter how
much or how little experience you have. Because they will judge your
skills based on <strong>your work</strong>, and there’s always a chance
that your ability to switch styles (along with showcasing your own
personal design style) could be what they’re looking for. For every job
post, there’s an <strong>email</strong> to contact the talent
recruitment person or a link to an online form to fill out &amp;*
submit; Send them the link to your portfolio, answer any questions they
may have, and await a reply. Don’t stop working on your portfolio and
draftsmanship, while waiting to be accepted you need to <a

<p>Some studios require you to fill out a form on their website, this
way it always goes to the same talent recruiting / HR person on staff.
Where they can process the intake of applications and will be forwarded
to the relevant department heads, studio director, or the creative lead,
who can ascertain the skill sets displayed in the portfolio. This
process will then have them determine to hire you, or place you on a
waitlist, or have a test delivered to you, to bring you to the next
phase of potentially being hired.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_865.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Filling out and submitting those forms are easy. There’s usually a
spot to fill out for a body of text, where you can insert or type out a
cover letter or brief introduction about yourself. In either case, if
you seem enthusiastic, straight-to-the-point, open to start anytime and
anywhere and eager to help them out, it can go a long way to reveal your
solid work ethic and positive attitude.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of what that cover letter (email message) from you
could look like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm sending this email to apply for the Character Design position at
your studio. As I've just recently finished my portfolio that you can
see here (insert your website URL), I'm very eager to start gaining some
real-world experience in the animation industry. I've been a huge fan of
animation and cartoons my whole life, and I have been drawing my own
characters and developing my own stories since I was a child.</p>
<p>This passion has only grown as I've gotten older, as cartoons have
begun to expand into a vast array of different genres and are constantly
exploring more and more concepts and ideas. I'm currently a massive fan
of series such as (insert name of an animated series). The use of color
in the character designs and their costumes truly evoke a strong sense
of what the characters’ struggles &amp; personalities are and how they
fit in their environments. I also adore the art and animation style of
(insert name of another animated series), its unique qualities within
the series' universe, such as its loose regulations for physical
consistency within the characters - while still maintaining its own set
of logic and rules within the world and show itself. At the same time,
it seamlessly blends the cartoony style of the characters with its
detailed backgrounds.</p>
<p>Since my college course has ended, I have been keeping myself
occupied by expanding my knowledge in (Harmony, Photoshop &amp;
Blender). I've been teaching myself the principles of designing
characters in a variety of different styles. It's for this reason I
would absolutely love the opportunity to work at (insert studio name
here). I feel I should also note that I’m willing to take any character
design test as well, to show you where my skill sets are, and how
quickly I can learn. I would love a short internship at your studio, or
any junior design position like prop design and character design
assistance, or even contribute to tasks like finishing turnarounds or
doing clean-up on designs and poses.</p>
<p>Thank you kindly for the opportunity.</p>
<p>(Your Name)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just an example, and you should customize and personalize
this template to make it fit to your personal preferences, along with
the work and parameters of the job you’re asking about. Replace the
names of the shows, the name of the studio you’re writing to, and the
software names with your own. After you’ve gotten your first job or two,
you’ll never need cover letters again, your portfolio will speak for
itself. But this letter gives you an idea of how it can be kept
short-and-sweet, while showing your appreciation for the craft. It
increases your chances when you demonstrate that you’re an impassioned
nerd about the art of character design!</p>

<h3 id="studio-design-tests">Studio Design Tests</h3>
<p>After applying to a studio by sending them the online link to your
<strong>character design portfolio</strong>, you may receive a design
test from them so that they can better determine where your skill sets
are and to see if you can adapt to their production’s art style. You’ll
be given reference and you’ll need to create a small cast of new
characters (or a turnaround for a single character) that matches the art
direction provided to you. In all cases, whether you are given a test to
do over a few days, or if they hire you on-the-spot, you’ll need to sign
an NDA. These are Non-Disclosure Agreements, this is a common practice
and understanding that you cannot divulge any information about the
property you are working on to anyone that isn’t working on the
property, before or during production (sometimes even a while after
production has ended). And you cannot place samples of the work you are
doing (or have done), online, or in your portfolio, until the production
has been broadcast, streamed, published, released, or made public.</p>
<p>Your ability to match the style of the property while showing your
originality, accuracy, consistency, and creativity will determine if you
get accepted on the team. Make sure you know what the parameters are; is
color required, how many views to draw, and what the deadline is. Exceed
their expectations by drawing clean, keeping the characters alive,
expressive, distinct, non-ambiguous, and instantly-recognizable, they
may also want to see your roughs and thought-process, so save all your
sketches too, include your progression in the design submission.</p>

<p>These tests are usually not paid for, so no need to ask them, and
they are structured to test your creativity &amp; resourcefullness. It’s
engineered to see how you would handle a specific kind of assignment,
and to see if your style (and interpretation of their style) is a good
fit for the production. It’s essentially acting like a <strong>job
interview</strong>, like when there’s try-outs for athletes to see if
they qualify to be in the competition or become a member of the team.
Similar to auditions for actors to perform a certain part in a play.</p>
<p>Suggestion: If they don’t provide a deadline, then complete the test
within 2 days. How promptly you return the artwork is a factor for how
they’ll determine your skill sets, unless the style is difficult or
they’re asking for lots of artwork as part of the requirements, showing
your commitment by responding quickly with results will go a long way.
Do not compromise quality, if you feel you can make the designs look
better if you had more time, then take that time to improve the
test.</p>
<p>If you’re hired, they send you the contract with the details outlined
on the specifics of the job, along with a start date!</p>
<p>Sometimes a design test will consist of designing several versions of
a single concept, like when the director wants to see 10 iterations of
the same character. For example, here the design test is to design a
Mailman in the style of Loud House:</p>

<h3 id="inside-the-studio">Inside The Studio</h3>
<p>Here’s a Survival Guide on what to expect once you’re hired as a
character designer for an animated series.</p>
<p>Staying inspired is a big part of the job. In addition to having a
firm grasp on the artistic and technical aspects of the work, there are
also some mental challenges that one must control in order to remain
effective.</p>
<p>Usually a character designer’s job has lots of work and
responsibility to it. It’s not an easy role, it can be a very very fun
job, but it can be very difficult and demanding work as well. It’s one
of the first roles to be hired on the production once the world is
developed, the characters are conceived, and the story is written.</p>
<p>Topics covered in this chapter include: finding the right amount of
ego, conquering inconsistent progress, managing the ebb and flow from
show-to-show, navigating studio politics, working with casting, catching
and missing breaks on a production, making the most out of every
opportunity, and letting go of emotional attachment to the work while
still getting the best designs you can. Let’s get started…</p>
<h4 id="attitude">Attitude</h4>
<p>The most common advice on attitude is to have a positive one.</p>
<p>This is, of course, easier said than done. It’s normal to have bad
days, we’re only human. It’s what you do with both the good and bad days
that can make or break your success and overall fulfillment in the
job.</p>
<p>Steadiness is the key and a proactive attitude is your best weapon.
Recognize the bad days, reflect on what made them bad, then let them go.
Embrace the good days, reflect on what made them good. The nuggets you
glean can keep you extremely motivated.</p>
<p>The scale of the successes and failures change but there will be
both.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Successes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Getting picked up on a show</li>
<li>Nailing your designs</li>
<li>Making a big contribution to a worthwhile project</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Failures:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Your characters get revised over and over</li>
<li>Missing deadlines</li>
<li>Characters reassigned</li>
<li>Not having a contract picked up</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>How you react to your circumstances says as much about you as a
designer as your work. The best advice is to try to stay humble after
success and to try and reset after failure. Not every success or failure
is a representation of your abilities. You may struggle on a turn-around
view, a whole character concept, or even for an entire show. It does not
mean you are not a good designer. You may just be working on something
that lays outside your sensibilities.</p>
<p>On the flip side, you may kick ass and work your way up into a top
position on one show, but not hold that position when moved to the next.
You can never expect special treatment because of your achievements and
don’t be bummed if you don’t get it. Try to maintain a steady
professional attitude and this will speak volumes.</p>
<p>Ironically the FIRST portfolio you create to get your FIRST job is
your most important one, and yet it will be the WORST one of your
career. Your first portfolio is the one made to show your potential, so
that employers see that you have the basic raw skills needed to start
off in their studio, and at the least, to be contributing to their
productions in significant ways. Once you’ve finished your first
contract on your first show, most of your portfolio will be replaced
with the NEW work you’ve done. After each production after that, you
keep adding and replacing things to your portfolio, and with each
project being completed, you make yourself more valuable.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1014.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see from this chart, the factors that are most important
for Getting Hired versus Staying Hired, can change quite a bit. When you
are gunning for your first job, you don’t have any production experience
yet, so your speed is unknown, they don’t know how fast you are, and YOU
don’t even know how fast you can be, until you’re put to the test. The
quality of your FIRST portfolio will be weak compared to the one you’ll
have after only a few months of production work, but it’s all you have
to go by, and that’s fine, you have no reputation (good or bad) and your
speed is unknown to them (and yourself).</p>
<p>Your attitude and work ethic are also not known to any employer. So
first impressions are important, and the people hiring you are aware of
the fact that you are new to the process, so they are looking for
diversity in your skill range and on the stylistic and artistic level,
able to offer some creativity in your designs and accuracy within the
turn-around samples you provide. It shows that SPEED isn’t a factor
until you get hired, with that said, if you take a VERY long time in
completing a design test, then that would affect their decision in
hiring you, of course. So assuming you don’t take more than a few days
to complete the design test, then your quality and creativity is what
will impress them most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(\_/) ( •_•) /&gt;🍿&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you are hired, your attitude is actually MORE important to
keeping yourself employed than all other factors. Your quality and speed
will increase naturally as time goes on, you’ll develop your work-habits
reputation in this way. But if you maintain a positive attitude, help
others with their work, meet your deadlines, make yourself easy to work
with, ask questions, be consistent, stay reliable, offer resourceful
solutions to design problems, and always show a steady growth in your
skill level… you’ll stay employed forever.</p>
<p>What will matter MORE than your overall quality and speed, is your
positive attitude, your work ethic and your steady rate of improvement
(even if it is only small amounts over time). These will increase your
chances of staying hired, getting promoted, or getting transferred over
to the next new production as contracts end and new ones begin.</p>

<h4 id="ego">Ego</h4>
<p>The advice we typically hear around EGO is, “Check your ego.”</p>
<p>It is in your best interest to be a pleasant person to work with.
There will be egos. Expect it. How you handle yourself will truly make
or break your success at the studio.</p>
<p>Checking your ego only works when everyone else checks theirs as well
- which typically does not happen. There will be situations where this
happens and they're great, and there will be times where you will need
to have the confidence to stand up for yourself as well.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_741.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="building-your-confidence-level">Building your confidence
level</h4>
<p>Checking your ego and being humble doesn't mean putting down your
work. In a safe work environment such as college, this may work, but in
a professional environment you will be lowering people’s expectations of
your work.</p>
<p>Having confidence is part of the job. Your job as a designer is to
deliver the best and most appropriate concepts on the characters you are
given. You will face challenges every week, and you need to create
solutions to design problems all the time.</p>
<p>Doing so requires having some level of confidence in your abilities.
Failure can come from presenting half-baked ideas with your concepts
because of a lack of confidence or defaulting to other people’s
opinions. Getting input is KEY to a successful design, and bringing your
best to the table first shows that you are indeed giving your best.</p>
<p>You will get notes and notes and more notes, on most characters you
take on. That doesn’t mean you can switch off and rely on other people’s
opinions moving forward. Follow instructions, listen to feedback, read
the descriptions, but ALSO follow your instincts, that’s why they hired
you in the first place.</p>

<h4 id="your-growth">Your Growth</h4>
<p>The typical character designer’s journey into the industry looks like
this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Apply to animation studios, complete and submit the tests they send
to you.</li>
<li>Get hired and get your first design gig.</li>
<li>Struggle a bit getting up to speed once you get into your first
production.</li>
<li>Spend lots of extra hours to catch up to the demands of the
workload.</li>
<li>Start to crack the learning curve and make fast improvements.</li>
<li>Hit a stride and kick some butt.</li>
<li>Run into some inconsistency - some character designs you hit, some
you miss.</li>
<li>Getting on a great show is really where you make progress. End up on
a tough show - where you level off or stop making progress, then you’re
working really hard just to stay afloat.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s a non-linear path. Why? Well for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Talent - you need to build it. It takes time and practice.</li>
<li>Skill level - where you are at is indicative of the type of job
you’ll be ready for.</li>
<li>Experience - the more you have typically the more desirable you’ll
be.</li>
<li>Situation - relocation, work visas, family, getting a position on
good shows and bad shows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Expectations of what it’s like in a studio:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We pick up certain things at college and then at jobs in smaller
studios.</li>
<li>Working on a smaller project can be a greater opportunity for
creative input.</li>
<li>When making the transition to a larger studio, realize it’s a
gradual process to learn everything you need to know.</li>
<li>In most cases you will be starting in a smaller role and building up
to your vision of the ideal position you want to be in.</li>
<li>On a small production in a small studio you might have to do
everything for the character designs; full turnarounds, colors,
expressions, mouth charts, hand charts. In a big production, at a big
studio, you might only be doing one aspect; maybe just clean-up, or
finishing turns, since you’ll be part of a team, where each member
specializes in one or two areas, because there’s a high volume of
characters that need to get done every week.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a perfect world every character designer would:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Work at their studio of choice.</li>
<li>Be on a project that they feel strongly about.</li>
<li>Make a meaningful creative contribution to the production.</li>
<li>Be part of a supportive crew that values their work and respects
their opinion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality of this job:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Every once in a while all of these elements will come together, in a
positive way, and in your favor. However, it is rare to have them all
fall into place at once even at the best of studios.</li>
<li>As pros we must find ways to do our best work and find creative
satisfaction even while we’re not working under optimal conditions.</li>
<li>As an entry level designer, and a lot of times as a mid-level
designer, nearly all of these factors come down to breaks. Which means,
for the most part, things that are out of our control.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="the-breaks">The Breaks</h4>
<p>In this business sometimes you catch the breaks and sometimes you
don’t. Opportunities don’t always line up with qualifications. Luck and
timing definitely play a factor.</p>
<h4 id="breaks-include">Breaks include</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Getting Hired
<ul>
<li>Timing (lots of luck)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Which Project
<ul>
<li>There may be a show in the works that’s right up your alley but your
skills are needed on a different show</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your Leads
<ul>
<li>Different leads/supervisors have different styles</li>
<li>Some leads like to build up their teams</li>
<li>Some like to be very regimented in the process of the daily tasks
and require constant communication about your progress</li>
<li>Others are more soft-spoken and keep communication to a minimum and
just let the artists do their work</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="other-design-roles">Other design roles</h4>
<p>There are different jobs and positions for designers, some are more
glamorous than others. Alternative roles include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Prop Designer:</strong> Producing all objects, items and
vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Clean-up Artist:</strong> Producing the final line,
maintaining consistency and volumes while tracing the rough lines.</li>
<li><strong>Design Revisionist:</strong> Revises character designs
according to client notes or art director’s notes.</li>
<li><strong>Design Assistant:</strong> Also known as a Junior Designer,
they do a bit of everything, finishing turnarounds, doing redresses on
existing characters, creating head tilts, re-dressing re-use characters,
creating hand charts and mouth charts on approved characters,
prepping/labelling files to be exported so they can be shipped out and
presented for review.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="best-practices">Best practices</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>The biggest complaint from designers is that they feel they are not
being used to their full potential.
<ul>
<li>It’s not always the production’s goal to use you to your full
potential. The goal is to get the series/film done at a consistent pace
and at a high quality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It’s important to realize that the breaks are just that, and are, in
most cases, out of your control.
<ul>
<li>You could end up spending energy worrying about this stuff to the
point where it affects the work and your attitude.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The best practice is to make the most of the opportunities that
present themselves.
<ul>
<li>When you get your first job there will be very little “training”,
most likely none at all, you’ll be thrown into the work right away. You
will have to dive in and learn what is required of you as you work
through it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try not to take it too hard when you miss the breaks, because there
will be other opportunities.
<ul>
<li>No one opportunity will make or break your career in
animation/character design.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What determines being picked for character design on a
production:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Experience</li>
<li>Skill set</li>
<li>Personal style</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Sensibility</li>
<li>Inventory/Availability</li>
<li>Momentum</li>
<li>Trust in you by the Art Director</li>
</ol>
<p>What constitutes a ‘good’ character? Is it a Main Character or
Primary Character? That might be a common consensus, since they’ll have
the most screen time, they’ll need the most attention, they’re the most
important to the story, the most views will need to be illustrated, and
the most additional assets made for it. However, some Supporting
Characters often become more interesting and more fun to create; the
sidekicks, the villains, the old wiseman, the quirky relative, the funny
co-worker, the classroom friend, these usually become the more memorable
characters in a film or series. When YOU think of your favorite
character from an animated movie or series, it’s very rare that it’s the
Lead Character.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_904.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What are your sensibilities or specialities? You’ll discover these as
time goes on, and your directors will notice what areas are your
strengths and weaknesses. You may prefer to draw more mechanical/robot
characters, it might be more cartoony funny-looking characters, it might
be more realistic-looking human characters, or it might be animals and
creatures. Your specialties and preferences will reveal themselves and
will grow over time. You may end up on a production that has a style
that you are very unfamiliar with, take the opportunity to research,
practice and learn from it, you will only become a stronger artist as a
result.</p>
<p>You may be offered a job that you can’t accept because you haven’t
finished your current contract yet. Try not to worry about missed
opportunities like this. First, see if you can work on BOTH, because if
the overlap between both projects is manageable and you’re willing to
work overtime in order to wrap up on one production while starting on a
new one, then it could work out good for everyone. This way you don’t
miss your chance on the other cool job. Also, you can talk to the Line
producer or Director, to see if you can start a bit later and catch up
with some over time later, this way, you don’t miss that contract
entirely, especially if it’s a show you’re looking forward to.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1135.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you see that there’s another production in the studio that they’re
doing character designs for and you love the look and style of it, but
you’re stuck on the other less-appealing show, ask your supervisor/art
director if you can possibly transfer over to the more desirable
project. The more experience you have the more they will make changes to
accommodate your preferences. Most times they cast and pick which
designers go on which productions based upon their style, speed, and
strengths. They can’t always meet your requests, but it doesn’t hurt to
ask.</p>
<h4 id="speed">Speed</h4>
<p>Each production is different for expectations on what rate of speed
is required. Usually each character takes two weeks from concept to
completion. But you are always working on several characters at once,
some require more turn-around views than others, some require more
angles and mouth charts and hand poses than others. It all depends on
how comprehensive the design pack for each character is.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_028.gif" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don’t beat yourself up about not being a fast
designer:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speed develops with time and the good news is that you’re not going
to be getting A+ characters at the studio on day one. They will give you
simple characters in the beginning, or tasks that have you assisting a
more senior designer. So you can learn the studio’s pipeline, learn the
etiquette in the reviews of your designs, and learn how to receive
feedback, be mindful and resourceful when implementing the revisions to
your work. Steady consistency in your performance and work quality and
slow but gradual consistency in your rate of improvement will ALWAYS be
noticed by your directors and supervisors.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_026.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="feedback">Feedback</h4>
<p>The feedback loop changes slightly from show to show. Once you’ve had
a few years of experience and a few shows under your belt, you’ll see
there’s a few patterns of workflow that work best, here are a few
standards and bits of advice that would be good to know for most
studios…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Understanding launches and review meetings:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Design Launch - every week or two, you’ll have a meeting with the
Art Director about your new design assignments, and what factors you
need to consider and what references you need to use.</li>
<li>Design Review - every week there’s a meeting reviewing new and
revised designs from the previous week, this is when your art
director/design supervisor and possibly the showrunner, all offer
feedback and creative direction. This could be in-person or through a
live video conference call, and also as redlines/draw-overs with written
notes in the form of emails and in online documents/spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Know what type of forum is it for the weekly
reviews:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Are opinions being solicited?</li>
<li>In most cases it is a presentation of work to the art directors
&amp; series director for their feedback.</li>
<li>Sit back and observe the etiquette and be sure to respect it.</li>
<li>Getting multiple sources of feedback is often disruptive for a
character, but it’s often unavoidable, there will be times where you get
notes from a director and showrunner that might contradict each other,
when this happens - see if there’s a way to accommodate both notes with
a compromise, or communicate with your supervisor/director (after the
meetings) on what the best course of action is.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Different directors and supervisors have different
expectations from designers:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some will value your opinion, some won’t.</li>
<li>Some will have an open dialogue. Sometimes the dialogue is
one-sided.
<ul>
<li>Try not to take it personally.</li>
<li>Stay humble.</li>
<li>Stay focused.</li>
<li>Remind yourself of what the goals are.</li>
<li>What is the intention behind the character personalities and their
purpose in the story.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="addressing-notes">Addressing notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Get a feel for the director’s sensibilities, try to get in their
head.</li>
<li>If you are just hitting the notes you’re not doing enough.</li>
<li>Avoid becoming simply a pair of hands.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Own your designs and your notes and get to the root of
critiques and feedback:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting back on the horse…</p>
<ul>
<li>You willhave your favorite characters changed or cut out.</li>
<li>Don’t let tough notes and story changes take the wind out of your
sails.</li>
<li>With tough notes try to take a step back and find the meaning behind
the note. Approach the revision in a way that still keeps your
contribution valid and creative.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ebb-and-flow">Ebb and flow</h4>
<ul>
<li>When you first start off in the industry, everything is
precious.</li>
<li>Big notes or character changes feel devastating.</li>
<li>Working on a character design can be a rollercoaster.</li>
<li>When our character design progress is doing well, we are doing
well.</li>
<li>You can be on top of the world one day while things are going well,
and then be absolutely broken up the next when things start falling
apart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time you realize that the best approach is to have a slight
emotional detachment from your work, and this attitude develops over
time. Finding the combination of commitment to the production and
dedication to the work is the secret recipe to live by. Stay a bit
detached from the work so that you are not so devastated and crushed
when designs get changed drastically, or given to someone else to do, or
cut out of the production entirely. But not too detached if you don’t
care about the work, if you don’t commit yourself fully to the
production, it shows in your art and your creativity will suffer.</p>

<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Politics are everywhere:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In hiring, casting, advancement. It’s a part of the game.</li>
<li>When politics work in your favor, they almost seem invisible.</li>
<li>When they work against you, it can be frustrating.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The nature of politics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It’s not all evil.</li>
<li>If you were to start a project, who would you hire?</li>
<li>Would you search long and far for the best candidate, or would you
first start with people that you know and trust?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>People working politics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It’s not unusual to see people schmoozing.</li>
<li>This again is one of the things outside of your control.</li>
<li>There will be people who find success this way.</li>
<li>There will also be folks who try to, and it backfires.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Best practices:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sta’y true to your nature.</li>
<li>Let the schmoozers schmooze and focus on doing the best work you
can.</li>
<li>Double down on your strengths, work on fixing your weaknesses a
little bit at a time.</li>
<li>Your best network connections are your peers.</li>
<li>Remember this and remember to not burn bridges.</li>
<li>Thi’s industry is very small.</li>

<h4 id="experience">Experience</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Clarity over time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The experience you will gain in the first 8 weeks of your first job,
will out-weigh all the stuff you learned in your courses.</li>
<li>As days and weeks go by, we realize that our perception of our own
work has changed, you will look back on the stuff you did 2 months ago,
and you’ll see your mistakes and what aspects you do differently
now.</li>
<li>There are so many things in this industry that seem confusing at the
time but become crystal clear with more experience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Looking back on the work:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You’ll look back on times that you felt you were struggling and
spinning your wheels and realize that you were growing in ways you
didn’t notice.</li>
<li>Other times you might think that you were shafted on a certain show
by being given crappy characters to work on, only to look back and
realize that your skill wasn’t at the level to take on bigger tasks
yet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The level is always going up across the industry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Keeping up is an effort in it of itself - You have to give yourself
credit.</li>
<li>The demand for high quality work rises with each passing year in
film work and series/streaming properties. You need to stay current and
up to date on everything you can see that is being worked on; new
releases, new shorts, new films, new shows, and realize you must always
be working on how to improve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>On growth in your environment:</strong>
<ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Closing the gap between beginner and skilled designer through
practice:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>You will learn that this industry is all about process. It's a funny
thing because I was so desperate early on in my career. I remember
thinking “like, man, I wish I could just take a pill that would just
instantly make me better at this”... And I ask students today, I say,
“who here, if you could take a pill and you'd just be a great designer
and animator, who here would take it?” Of course, everybody would. But
that thinking is really interesting to me because it just highlights
this sort of backwards notion that it's results over process and results
are inevitably shallow. And the more you work at your craft, the better
the results become.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice is what turns amateurs into professionals. Across
every field, deliberate practice is what creates top performers and what
they use to stay at the top of their game. As a general concept,
‘practice’ means preparing, and it’s absolutely essential for expert
performance. It’s the act of repeatedly performing certain activities
with the intention of improving a specific associated skill. We rehearse
what to do in low-pressure situations so we’ll be better when we use a
skill in situations where something is actually at stake, such as in a
competition or in the workplace with a fast-approaching deadline.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you really want this high quality result, this
professional result, and you don't know how to get it and you see other
people doing it and you're like “ah, I don't know how they're doing
that.” And it's frustrating and it’s this scary thing, because it's not
like you’re bummed about being bad at what you're trying to do. It's
about not knowing what to do about that. And the answer is deceptively
simple, which is… just do more. That's it, but it doesn't always feel
like doing more is working. But it's the only answer, and the results of
your hard work seem painstakingly slow and invisible.</p>
<p>I would start to visualize because I was getting frustrated and
distracted with emotion, all this kind of stuff and the pressure of
getting better faster. And so I would visualize what my best work could
be like, and it seems to live way out there, out of reach. There's no
way to get at your best work fast and instantly.</p>
<p>I visualized that as it existed and between it and me was just this
long like, you know, tunnel of shit that I just had to dig through. And
just move these bad sketches and designs out of the way. You work at a
design, over and over to get the first ones, the bad ones out of the
way, and eventually the superior design starts to emerge from the mess
of roughs you make. And by doing that and going through that, what you
realize is that the results start to, or the importance of the result,
start to reveal themselves, and the progress is huge.</p>
<p>The progress is small, the process is a burden, you know when you
first start, you're digging for this result, and the process is just
like you're enduring it and it's this burden or this task that you gotta
fight your way through. And, you know, it gets so cumbersome, but
working through a hundred bad drawings is what will get you to those few
amazing ones. Like what pro photographers say, you need to take a
hundred photos before you nail that one good one.</p>
<p>Even just seeing the software, or the blank page looking back at you,
it can be a major mental block to overcome, you get up in the morning
and you sit down at your computer and you see that little Photoshop icon
and you're like “ugh-- don't even wanna click on it” - because
everything about that thing makes me feel intimidated by the work that’s
ahead of me. It doesn't give me any positive feedback at all. It just
keeps going like, “hey, you're terrible.”</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you MUST fall in love with the process. The
discovery, the collaborating, the iterations, the many many versions you
need to create, all to arrive at the final results, to explore and find
the character for yourself. Within this process, is how you grow as an
artist, build up those experience points and learn to be better at your
craft.</p>

<h3 id="contracts-schedules">Contracts &amp; Schedules</h3>
<p>Here’s the very boring aspect of the job. This can be a difficult
subject to talk about, but here’s some suggestions and thoughts on the
topic of salaries and pay rates for when you get a character design job
- this all depends on many different factors: Average hours of work,
amount of designs being asked of you, deadlines and expected output
speed, amount of revisions being asked of you to do, your personal level
of experience, and how much is involved with each design (3-point
Turnaround? Full 8-point Turnaround? Head Angles?
Poses/Expressions/Mouth Charts? Quick Color Concepts or Full Color?)...
So there’s many elements involved, which is why a good starting point is
to settle on a daily rate for yourself, and compare that with the
offer-of-pay or work contract being given to you.</p>
<p>The first thing for YOU to determine is to know if you will be
exclusive to this client/employer. This means that regardless of whether
you only do 3 characters per week with full turnarounds and no-color and
two revision passes, or 5 characters per week with only two views and
one revisions pass, you assume that you are full time, exclusive to this
studio/director/client, and if you are consistent at putting in 8-9
hours per day (5 days per week) of work, and that is how much you are
willing to dedicate to this production and to this client - then your
fair rate of pay can be determined from that. Sometimes they need you
only in a freelance (hourly) capacity, one week you’ll perhaps be
full-time, the next week only half time, and they require you to pass in
a timesheet that logs your hours and you get paid accordingly. Or are
you paid by the character (as they get completed or approved)? Or are
you simply on salary expected to produce an average predetermined amount
of characters every week. Ask these questions, or read your contract to
determine what are your parameters and your expected output of work.</p>
<p>There might be an exclusivity clause in your contract, if so, realize
that this means that if they catch you working for any other
client/employer while under contract with them, they would have the
right to terminate your employment. This is because exclusivity means
you can only work for them while under their employment, this is a good
thing, because it usually means they will pay you well, and want you to
work full time and maybe even overtime for them and only them. If you
find the pay is not fair (kinda low) given these terms, then you need to
negotiate a higher salary or have them remove the exclusivity clause
from your contract (their choice).</p>
<p>By working on multiple productions (very possible when working from
home), you can be working on 2 or 3 or more projects at once, as long as
they’re all part-time jobs. Just be careful to not get too overwhelmed
and overworked, and do not miss deadlines or compromise quality with
your supervisors/directors.</p>
<p>All this stuff can be boring (or stressful) to think about, and tough
to figure out with your employer. Don’t worry about this too much, most
of the time, your employer (the studio’s line producer, operations
manager, production manager) has it ALL written out for you, if there’s
lots of legal jargon you can’t decipher from your contract, ask for a
sit down or a screen-sharing video call to have them walk you through
your contract, prior to signing and submitting it to them.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_547.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The daily rate system:</p>
<p>The client may want to pay a certain amount per hour or a certain
amount per character, this is fine, from this info (and the rate they
offer you) you can determine the daily rateyou’re comfortable with,
knowing you’ll work full time, 8-9 hours per day, then you can easily
determine what is fair and reasonable. Perhaps the client only has
enough work for you to do 2 or 3 days per week? Then your daily rate
still applies.</p>
<p>For example, if you set your daily rate to be $200 per day -- Then it
doesn’t matter how many characters per week, or how many revisions on
your designs are requested. From this rate (or whatever rate you feel is
fair) you can determine how much your income would be for a weekly rate
or a per-character rate (on average), then you must determine (with your
boss/client/director) how many characters you can develop per week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/// This is only an example, it’s between you and your employer (and
the production budget) what the adequate rate should be based on the
work and the schedule ///</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know you’re working 8 to 9 hours daily. This may translate into 5
characters in one week with 4-point turnarounds and a few head angles
for each, or it may be only 2 characters because the client wanted to
see several rounds of rough concepts and then had a few passes of notes
on your turnaround views and color passes. Either way, your TIME
coincides with your <strong>rate of pay</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1253.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the client wants to pay you $800 per character and each character
is a 5-point turnaround, clean line-art (no color), a few poses and
expressions, with only two rounds of notes at the rough and rotation
stages, at a rate of 4 characters every 2 weeks, and that is the
agreed-upon consistency of work - then you must determine if this is
do-able in the time constraints laid out. It may be a high rate of pay,
but the work may not be do-able in the provided schedule. Often some
testing is required, and the first one or two characters will determine
how difficult the work will be. A two week trial period is not
uncommon.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_492.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once the style is established, are you able to do that amount of work
to meet their weekly quota? If you are able to do this amount of work
within the 40-45 hour time span to complete it, then you are meeting
your personal <strong><em>daily rate</em></strong>, and your client is
receiving the adequate amount of designs from you, so everyone is happy;
the client gets the characters from you, and you are getting paid well
for the work. You figure out: I will work 8-10 hours per day, I want to
get paid $240 per day regardless of how much work there is, multiply
that rate by ten (10 days in a standard 2-week period), then that’s your
salary that you’re aiming for, and your client expects to characters
being completed every week, just an example!</p>
<p>If the client wants to pay you $1400 per week, flat rate, with a
yet-to-be-determined amount of work per week, then make certain the
deadlines are realistic, since they can quickly overlap and build up, as
we’ve seen in this document there can be many stages in the creative
process simply in attempting to find the character’s personality in the
design along with locking down the style itself. This could have you
spending weeks in the concept art phase, and then weeks to go through
approvals for costumes, turn-around views, colors, and the many other
technical aspects to complete the design sheets. Most times you don’t
KNOW how realistic the deadlines will be until you dive into it, and
experience the workflow of a typical 2 week cycle.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_688.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>There are a few factors to consider:</strong></p>
<p>Is there an established character design style to follow?</p>
<p>If not, how many days or weeks of time is there for you (or someone)
to do the necessary visual development ahead of time in order to
ascertain the design style? If there’s lots of steady feedback - how
long will this feedback from the director/client take? Be aware (and
make your boss aware) that the development side of the design could take
several weeks, and could be treated as its own contract or its own
project. Because when it comes to discovering the style, then this one
first character could take SEVERAL WEEKS to complete, and only once this
style is locked down then the creation of the other characters will go
much much faster. Again, you expect a daily rate no matter what, they
are paying for your time, if it’s $250/day, then you know you will
commit a certain number of hours weekly to help get the production’s
character development style into view and made to their liking. How this
gets quantified is up to them. The norm is to get paid every 2 weeks for
the work performed during the time worked over the previous two
weeks.</p>

These $ numbers are not to be taken literally, every employer is
different, every budget is different, and all studios are all different
in their pay structures that are based upon your speed, experience and
agreed-upon contract - so use these as a baseline example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first the nature of the work can present itself in a few different
ways; It could mean exploring lots of different styles before even a
single character is approved. But once the first one is approved, it
sets up the template for all other characters to follow on the same
visual path.</p>
<p>Character #1 could take 3 weeks to complete, as you’ll be required to
explore, rough out, and later refine the style for the main principle
characters that will have the most time on-screen, but after that you
can be creating a single-view character at a rate of 1 to 3 per day, so
your output will accelerate considerably depending on how rough the
sketches can be or how clean your submissions can be. Your personal
speed translates into the amount of work output. The more efficient you
are at producing a higher rate of characters per week, the more valuable
an employee you will become to them.</p>
<p>Be aware that spending 2 hours on a rough character concept can be
dragged out over several weeks. Because you wait on feedback, then redo
that rough along with some alternate versions, then you do it again,
then you refine it, then you make two more views, then there’s some
back-peddling, where the face and costume got looked at from another
executive and they had some thoughts and opinions. So than
previously-approved aspects of the character are now re-worked, this
affects other elements of the character, and makes the refining and
finalizing of a character to sometimes be a process that drags on for a
long time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_268.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You may be asked to fill out timesheets; these are logs that they
will ask from you the hours you do weekly. You may only do 20 hours of
actual work on a particular week if you were put on pause while
approvals were waiting to come in and you didn’t have other tasks to
work on in the meantime.</p>
<p>You may be asked to fill out tax credit forms, these are very normal.
TV/Film/Media tax incentives typically come in the form of Tax Credits,
equal to a percentage of a production’s qualified in- state/provincial
spending and/or exemptions from sales tax on qualified transactions.
Know that the production company relies on these forms to be signed so
that they can receive a tax return on the portion of the budget they
spend on artists’ salaries (your salaries). The state/provincial and
federal governments all pay for a significant portion of your salary
(usually between 30-60% of your wages), signing those documents helps to
make it all happen. Every city in every country has some sort of
film/television/new media/gaming labor incentives program that the
studio you work for must tap into, in order to complete the budget’s
production, this is the only way to get the deal from their client.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1229.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the style is already established, then it’s up to you to start
drawing/designing in that style as quickly as possible, which might mean
your first few characters will take lots more rounds of revisions and
notes before you can get on-track. Which might mean you’ll need to put
in more unpaid overtime in the first two weeks so that you can get your
skills up to the standards required. There’s nothing worse than falling
behind schedule within just the first week or two of production, but
don’t worry, this is VERY common. Clients and directors will expect you
to get accustomed to the style as soon as possible. This is a very
normal expectation for the animation industry.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_584.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the first week or two, you should be in a more solid groove and
in a more consistent routine for your own personal workflow, you’ve
practiced the style of the production a lot, and are getting the hang of
it. As with ANY new production, the first couple weeks are the most
difficult, as you might struggle to find your footing, and you will need
to burn more hours of time in order to prevent falling too far behind,
along with absorbing lots of notes and feedback on your designs.</p>
<p>Try to figure out what the parameters are and how to get into a
workflow, from week to week it might vary a lot, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1</strong>
<ul>
<li>2 Main Characters &gt; Rough Concepts (6-10 sketches)</li>
<li>2 Secondary Characters &gt; Rough Concepts (4-8 sketches)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Week 2</strong>
<ul>
<li>2 Main Characters &gt; Revisions - Refine select roughs</li>
<li>2 Secondary Characters - Approved &gt; Produce Clean Line art and
4-point turnaround</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Week 3</strong>
<ul>
<li>4 Character Redress &gt; Re-use Old Secondary Characters and place
new costumes and new color scheme</li>
<li>2 Main Characters - Approved &gt; Produce Clean Line art and 4-point
turnaround</li>
<li>2 Main Characters &gt; Produce Roughs for up and down head
angles</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Week 4</strong>
<ul>
<li>2 Secondary Characters - Line Art Approved &gt; Produce Color
pass</li>
<li>2 Main Characters &gt; Revisions - On the 4-point turnarounds</li>
<li>2 Main Character Props &gt; Backpacks, Goggles, Walking Stick</li>
<li>4 Character Redress &gt; Revisions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Week 5</strong>
<ul>
<li>4 Character Redress &gt; Revisions</li>
<li>2 Main Characters Turnarounds - Approved &gt; Produce Color
pass</li>
<li>2 Secondary Characters &gt; Revisions on Color</li>
<li>2 Main Character Props &gt; Revisions</li>
<li>2 Main Characters &gt; Revisions on Head Angles - Revise and make
line art version</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Week 6</strong>
<ul>
<li>2 Main Characters &gt; Mouth Charts (3 views each, for
happy+sad)</li>
<li>2 Main Characters &gt; Rough Poses (6) and Expressions (6)</li>
<li>2 Main Character Props &gt; Color pass</li>
<li>4 Character Redress &gt; Color pass</li>
<li>1 New Main Characters &gt; Rough Concepts</li>
<li>2 New Secondary Characters &gt; Rough Concepts</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>See how every week’s tasks tend to pile up when the previous week's
assignments come back to you with notes and adjustments, and you’ll
notice there’s lots of different stages to take care of. Normally color
is done by a color designer or color stylist, and mouth charts, or
additional costume changes and turnaround views are done by a secondary
designer. But sometimes, if there’s not that many characters to do each
week, then YOU will have to do almost everything. As you can see, by the
6th week the tasks begin to overlap, there’s at least 9 days of work
compressed in a single week, as you await feedback on other assets. So
be mindful of the hours you put in, keep track of the tasks you’re
given, <strong>stay organized</strong> with all the stages needed to be
completed for each task for every design asset. Always triple check to
make sure you re-read all the notes, making certain you cover everything
that is required of you to change or implement in your work. This will
help you to rack up those approvals.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_270.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The longer it takes for your client/director to come back with notes
on a design you submitted, the higher the chances the overlapping tasks
will accumulate. Simply take into account that there will always be some
unforeseen circumstances and you don’t have control over - like how long
it takes for designs to be reviewed or approved. Sometimes it needs to
go through several levels of approvals, filtering through many different
people. After a design is complete it can take several days or several
weeks before feedback returns to you, sometimes it can take just a few
hours. It depends how many people need to see it, how readily accessible
they are, how quick they are in providing comments and criticism, how
fast they are with other aspects of the production, and how fast they
are at reviewing and handing out notes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_007.gif" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Schedules and deadlines are no doubt one of the least fun aspects of
this work. But it’s an unavoidable reality of the job.</p>
<p><strong>If the workload becomes too much to handle, there’s a few
ways for you to tackle the situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>See if the over abundance of work will be temporary. For instance,
only for this week everything has converged and coincidentally multiple
deadlines have fallen on dates that merged in the same week, then you
can push through this exception and do the extra time and effort to get
the job done, as long as this is not a repeating pattern.</li>
<li>Is the style of the designs more difficult and demanding than
originally expected, or more laborious than initially agreed upon? Then
you talk to your supervisor/director/production manager and see what can
be done to alleviate the work, extend deadlines or have the volume of
work and/or notes be reduced? Otherwise, deadlines will be missed.
Request an assistant to help you in your tasks, or inform your
supervisor of the delays, make a prediction as to the date of completion
and make certain you meet that date. Keeping open communication with the
person in charge of deadlines or the one assigning you the work is
important.</li>
<li>Unforeseen circumstances like you getting sick and needing a day or
two toi recover, or the clients being unable to be decisive in their
notes, or creative decisions have led to a pile up of designs having to
be redone - all lead to disrupting the flow of work and forcing you to
spend more time than predicted to complete the designs that were
assigned to you. Communicate with your direct supervisor or director,
inform them of your progress, your estimated time of completion, the
reasons why you will need more time to finish the work, and discuss
strategies on how you can get help, so that the work can continue to go
through the pipeline without causing more delays.</li>
<li>There might be ways for you to be more efficient in your work. Does
the client trust you to bring the design task to the next stage without
them seeing it again? If the designs you complete will include the
revisions they gave you then ask them if you can push through to the
next stage. Therefore reducing the number of passes, and making you
consolidate more stages of approval to make things go faster with less
submission &amp; review time, which means less wait-time and less
overlapping tasks for YOU. Example - The client has seen3 passes of your
rough version, and on the last pass, they only had very minor tweaks to
your art. Ask if you can do those small adjustments AND proceed to doing
the turnaround views in order to prevent re-submitting the same design
again, costing you and them more time to review and offer feedback. Some
clients/directors do not allow any stage to move forward without 100%
approvals declared in the previous step, otherwise are very open to it
for the sake of efficiency, but usually trust has to be built up first
between you and them.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_021.gif" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These tactics can help to prevent you from being overwhelmed with too
many assets to complete at one time. Or perhaps MORE stages of review
are needed in order to prevent unnecessary work from being done. If you
produce lots of clean, polished artwork only for it to be torn apart and
rebuilt from scratch, then maybe to have a few rough stages as concept
passes in the beginning would work better to prevent unnecessary
revisions.</p>
<p>This way you’re not wasting time making too much clean line art, only
to have it re-done, and works best for more hands-on directors and
creative producers that are artists themselves. Doing quick rough
thumbnails with lots of options and variations for them to choose from
will have them see and understand your intentions more clearly, and
depending on the director, they may love to do draw-overs / redline
sketches, to help visualize their revisions for you.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_353.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This route works best when certain clients tend to approve a design
at the rough stage but then change their minds at the next clean/color
stages. Sometimes you don’t see a problem with the design until you
attempt various turn-around views, you can spot problematic areas that
force you to revise yourself to make the rotations work. So it’s faster
to do these rough concepts, it will minimize the revisions later as you
gradually refine the process and hone in on the approved look. This way
creates more submissions and more review stages, but each stage is
quicker and faster to do, and makes things slow at the start with lots
of changes as you are searching for the proper design, but the changes
are easier to do and notes coming back to you in later stages become
less and less.</p>
<p>Also be prepared for the times when work will pile up and will seem
overwhelming, just know that the wave will pass, and will not happen too
often.</p>
<p>Every project is different, when you are getting overwhelmed talk to
your supervisor/boss/client, about how to relieve the pressure or to
push back deadline dates.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1238.jpg" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In terms of your weekly salary or hourly rate, you rarely have room
to negotiate. Budgets are locked in and are out of your control, and in
most cases out of your boss’s control too. All the strategies outlined
above are for you to use in various situations. Later on in your career,
once you have lots of experience under your belt, there’s a better
chance to arrange and haggle on your salary as your skill set and
experience will make you of higher value (as an artist) to their
production and the studio at large. In the first few years of your
career as a character designer you are still learning the ways of the
production pipeline and what works best for your own workflow. As you
gain speed, efficiency and knowledge, you will rise in value, and
studios will begin to seek YOU out. Then you will have more room to
negotiate your work loads and salaries.</p>
<p>Deadlines and schedules can be the least fun aspect of this job. But
for YOUR own sanity, staying organized with your own workflow is vital
to staying efficient and stress-free.</p>
<p>Remember: You can base the combinations of labor vs time vs income by
starting with the <strong>daily rate</strong> system, and work your way
up or down from there. How much do you value a full day of work to be
for your skills? How much is a full-day-of-work for you? Assess the
difficulty and demands of the production, adjust your rate accordingly
and then compare with their contract offer. As you grow older and
increase those skill points, that rate gradually increases. As months
and years build up, so will your experience and speed, and so will your
value to any employer.</p>

<h3 id="commissions">Commissions</h3>
<p>While waiting on feedback from the animation studios on your
applications or design test submissions, or just during your free time
between work contracts, many artists do online freelance work through
commissions. There’s lots of advice for freelancers out there for how
commissions work, from one-time gigs, to full-time regular client work,
to online character illustration requests, including portraits and
caricatures. Commissions are far more informal and very casual, a simple
agreement between you and a client.</p>

<p>For one-on-one commission work like this, where you do a single
illustration for an individual, there’s no need for signing contracts.
Remember, you don’t hand off your work until you get paid.</p>
<p>There’s varying opinions on how artists should handle commission
work, see <a

<p>Here are some contracts for more professional works on bigger,
long-term projects to consider using between you and your clients:</p>

Artist / Client Toolkit</a></p>
<p>These are pre-made contracts and agreements where you really only
have to fill in the blanks with your name, date and signatures for
whatever occasions, be it cease and desist / original artwork /
commission work / all rights for limited time purposes. Read these
contract templates and arm yourself with them, and be sure to use the
appropriate ones. These are for you to use as an independent artist, for
medium to large sized projects between you and another individual,
purely for freelance work. Not to be used for character design studio
tests from animation/game companies and production studios, they will
provide you with their own contracts since they hire you as a contract
worker or employee for the services they want you to do for them.</p>

<p>Article by <em>Mark Mayerson</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not on salary or working under a contract and somebody
asks you to produce some art or character designs, here are the things
you need to know (in writing) before you start work.</p>
<ul>
<li>How much will you be paid and what is the payment schedule?</li>
<li>Are there royalties or other compensation you are entitled to in the
future?</li>
<li>What are the specifics of the work you are providing?</li>
<li>What format are you delivering the work in?</li>
<li>When is the work due?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there is the question of rights. What exactly are you selling in
exchange for the money?</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you selling the work outright?</li>
<li>Are you selling the work only for a specific use?</li>
<li>Are you selling the work for a limited amount of time?</li>
<li>Is the sale for exclusive or non-exclusive rights to use the
work?</li>
<li>Will the artist get screen credit or be allowed to sign the
work?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the client provides this information in a written document, you
have the right to ask for changes to anything that is specified. The
client has the right to say no, but so do you. An agreement implies that
both parties (the client and the artist) see eye to eye on conditions
under which the work will be produced.</p>
<p>You also have the right to consult a lawyer, agent or other
professional on the agreement before signing it.</p>
<p>There is a tendency for artists to be so thrilled that somebody wants
their work that they skip all of the above or worse, they agree to work
on spec. Spec work, (work done on speculation), means that the artist
produces work for a client with no promise of payment. There are also
cases where a client promises no money but offers the benefit of
experience or exposure.</p>
<p>There is a word that describes working for free: Slavery.</p>
<p>Slavery can only occur through force, which we have not yet sunk to
in North America, or complicity, where the artist agrees to be a
slave.</p>
<p>There are occasions where artists may choose to work for free. Work
gets donated to a charity or done to help a friend or family member. But
if a profit making company is asking for artwork, they should pay for it
and all of the above conditions should be met.</p>
<p>Please note that the above is different from pitching. In that case,
you are creating the artwork for yourself and hope to interest a buyer
in it. If no payment is forthcoming, you are free to take that artwork
elsewhere to try to market it. Doing free work for yourself is different
from doing free work at the request of a profit-making company.</p>
<p>I'm going to talk about two instances that I've been consulted on in
the past. I have to be vague so as not to break any confidence.</p>
<p>In the first case, a distributor was interested in a student film
made by a Sheridan graduate. The distributor wanted non-exclusive
theatrical rights and exclusive rights for DVD, VOD, TV, Internet and
Merchandising. In exchange for these rights, the distributor was willing
to pay $50. I told the grad that for the low fee, none of the rights
should be exclusive. If the grad had the opportunity to sell the film
again in any market, he should be able to do it. The student asked for
changes to the contract and the rights were made non-exclusive.</p>
<p>In the second case, a college grad from an animation program was
commissioned by a company to produce a short film for a fee. When the
film was delivered, the grad was told that the person who commissioned
the film didn't have authorization to do it. The company was sorry and
felt bad about it, but could only offer the grad half the agreed upon
fee as a gesture of good will. The grad asked me for advice. I warned
the grad that if she made a fuss, there was a chance that the company
would refuse all payment. The grad wanted to proceed anyway, so I
counseled the grad to tell them that she had an email from a company
employee and she looked upon that as a contract. If there was a problem,
it was between the company and the employee, not the company and her. If
they didn't pay her in full, she would publicize the fact that the
company had ripped her off and would warn other artists not to do work
for the company. Furthermore, if the company didn't pay the full fee and
used the work, she would sue the company for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>The company responded that they regretted her aggressive tone. This
is known as blaming the victim. However, they did agree to pay the full
fee.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of companies looking to take advantage of young
artists. It is important to understand the proper way to do business,
demanding a signed, written agreement that covers the payment, the
rights, the deadline, and the deliverables, before the artwork is
created. Your art and your time are what you are selling as a
professional. If you work for free or don't proceed in a professional
manner, you are merely a hobbyist and you are hurting people who are
professionals in this industry.</p>

<h3 id="staying-productive">Staying Productive</h3>
<p>Your journey in learning has only begun! Here are a few strategies
that can really help boost your creativity and productivity:</p>
<h4 id="have-a-designated-creative-space">1. Have a Designated Creative
Space</h4>
<p>Because of the way our brains are wired, it can be much easier to get
creative if your brain associates a specific location with your artistic
practice. So, allocate a nice, comfortable space for yourself. Whether
it's a desk, couch, bed, or even somewhere outdoors that you enjoy. The
most important thing about whatever creative space you pick is that it
should be cozy and functional. Remember to make sure your tools are also
easily accessible in or nearby this space!</p>
<p>Have a portable creative space (and tools) also, like <a

<h4 id="start-a-multi-part-project">2. Start a Multi-Part Project</h4>
<p>A great way to motivate yourself to get creative immediately is to
set yourself a project that requires multiple different pieces. Maybe
it's a small comic (do one panel per day), a series of character
studies, or even just participating in a month-long art challenge;
there’s many to choose from only like Inktober, the 100DayProject, or
other themed challenges like drawing a specific object daily, or
exploring different art styles, or a series a small digital paintings.
There’s dozens of options like these to try out amongst online
communities. Follow your intuition: <a

<p>By providing yourself with an ongoing project you are going to add

</ul>
<h4 id="take-breaks">4. Take Breaks</h4>
<p>When working full time: Every hour, take a 5 minute break. It’s
important to get up, stretch, look out the window to get your eyes
adjusted to focusing on distant objects again, hydrate, or get some
coffee/snacks in you, but doing this refreshes your brain too, it’s a
mini-reset, before getting back down to focusing on the work.</p>
<p>Sometimes you get in a state of hyper-concertration, time flies by.
You’re in a flow state, also known as "being in the zone," a mental
state of complete immersion and energized focus in an activity, leading
to deep enjoyment and effortless action. Only when you naturally break
away from that, THEN take a break. There’s nothing wrong with prolonged
states of productivity.</p>
<h4 id="fifteen-minutes-a-day">5. Fifteen Minutes a Day</h4>
<p>15 minutes a day seems pretty easy, right? By setting yourself an
achievable amount of practice time you are much more likely to be
consistent. You aren’t always going to have infinite time each day to
practice, and setting larger time goals can make creativity feel like a
daunting chore! So, aim for just 15 minutes a day, some days you might
even start and then decide you feel like creating for hours instead!
Either way, you will be achieving your goal. During these 15 minutes,
focus on drawing/painting a new style, or learning a new piece of
software, or just watching a tutorial for a new software or
technique.</p>

<p>Sketchbook doodles by Laura Horobin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you doodle in your sketchbook, do so knowing that you should
NEVER show your sketchbook contents to ANYONE, not EVER... Why? Because
if you can keep telling yourself to never show your sketches from your
books to anyone, it will FREE you to grow faster as a character artist!
It will free you to draw in it more, free you to stay rough and loose,
free you to try out different things, and without the burden of
wondering ‘what will people think?’ You are not creating sketches to
eventually show to someone, this is purely for your own growth and
benefit. The freedom of knowing this, knowing that your sketches aren't
for anyone to see, will allow you to draw in it more. Permitting you to
stay fast and rough and to draw anything and to draw in the book more
without the fear of being judged or critiqued. THIS will make your
skills evolve faster, knowing that it’s ONLY for practice, and this way
you’ll fill up sketchbooks quicker, and doing this will accelerate your
artistic improvements.” -Portion from a Character Design Workshop by Ron
Doucet</p>

<h4 id="just-get-started">7. Just Get Started</h4>
<p>Let’s call it <em>'using inertia'</em>. It’s a million times easier
to keep doing something once you have started. So if I don’t feel like
working out I tell myself I’ll just do a short work out. Or if the
dishes need to be done I’ll tell myself to do one. More often than not,
once I start doing something my brain stops fighting so much against it.
It’s a psychological trick you play on yourself to get motivated.</p>
<p>The important thing though is to let yourself only do the short
workout or that one dish if you start and still are fighting yourself.
Otherwise you just don’t start in the first place because you know you
are really talking about doing the whole thing.</p>

<p>Usually, it's the initial push, the start of something, anything,
which is the most challenging or difficult. But once we start what we
want to do and build up momentum, continuing that task is easier. Also
known as the 'Theory of Momentum'. The same can be said about going from
one task to another. If you go to work, then immediately go to the gym,
cook dinner, put away laundry, without taking a rest between each task,
accomplishing each becomes easier, the break and rest you take later
will feel much more satisfying. This momentum helps you to flow from one
task to the next without having to expend that initial starting energy
for each individual task. <a

<blockquote>
<p>“The best way to draw in your sketchbook? The messier the better,
just let it all out. Doodles, scribbles, notes, sketches, unfinished
drawings ... everything. Trying to keep your sketchbooks neat and tidy
with only "nice" drawings can actually end up holding you back from
making the leaps of progress that truly-free experimentation allows.
That's not to say your sketchbook can't be neat, or tidy, or have
beautiful drawings, but if you make those things your exclusive goal,
you may be missing out on a big part of what a sketchbook can do for you
and your art. At its best a sketchbook is not your best-ofs.” - Lorenzo
Etherington</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beginners rarely know where to start. This is why it’s so difficult
to jump right into drawing because there’s so much to learn and there’s
no specific direction to go.</p>
<p>To handle this, just organize a small lesson plan that fits into the
time you have. If you’re only drawing for 1 hour each day then you might
do a breakdown of 20 minutes of gesture drawing, 20 minutes of shape
drawing, and 20 minutes of geometric/perspective drawing.</p>

<p>When first getting started you need to put the most effort into your
fundamentals. It’s fine to make time for fun drawing. But this isn’t
real focused practice and won’t yield the quickest rate of growth.

<h4 id="dont-stop-learning">8. Don’t Stop Learning</h4>
<p>Even when you are not working, there’s always something you can do to
prepare yourself, and better yourself, for when the work starts up
again! You’ll never stop learning, throughout your entire career as an
artist. Art and design is a life-long journey of a non-stop habit of
exploration and discovery. Where practice will never make perfect, it
will only lead to more practice. Be inspired by other people’s
journeys:</p>

<p>Every artist/teacher/author has their own style and ways of showing
illustration techniques, sometimes you’ll even notice some will
contradict the advice of others (and that’s OK, try everything and see
what works best for YOU), many of these books and videos cover the same
aspects that were mentioned in this document. But there is always a lot
to gain through this repetition of methods and thought process. Read all
these books and watch all these tutorials, learn and hold on to as much
as you can, on some occasions you may see some information that
contradicts other things, but this is all for you to filter in and
absorb the things that make most sense to you and your
sensibilities.</p>
<p>Learn from the old masters like <a
href="https://youtu.be/bUlop3ogWPA?t%3D6&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865523991&amp;usg=AOvVaw3YOziurcvQbCIdw2ebykKc">Kim

<p>Different artists and teachers all have their own unique experiences
and points-of-view. One may say to do something one way, while the other
proclaims another way. Ultimately YOU must pick and choose what you want
to learn from and adopt and absorb for your own self. Try out various
techniques and the ones that work best for you, will be the lessons and
methods you hold on to, and put into practice.</p>
<p>The dedication and commitment needed to do the job is like any other
discipline - painters, sculptors, writers, musicians, chefs, visual
artists, we have to immerse ourselves in the material, know it well,
then dive into the work, as actor Walter Goggins explains <a

<p>Art director Connie Kang created a great exercise for herself here,
in her post with this artwork, she wrote:</p>
<p>Excited to share a new series of animal-to-human character designs
I’ve been working on! Each piece reimagines an animal as a unique human
personality — blending nature, fashion, and storytelling. It’s a fun
exploration of body language, attitude, and identity through the lens of
character design.</p>

<p>Creating a series of illustrations like this can really get you to
think about creatively depicting story, attitude, personalities and
atmosphere within your characters.</p>
<p>Find exercises to try out, have fun with them, and fill up your paper
sketchbooks (or digital sketchbooks) - for example, you can try this…
cram as many different characters as you can on one page:</p>

<h4 id="organize-your-self-improvement-lessons">10. Organize Your
Self-Improvement Lessons</h4>
<p>You should start by setting aside time to draw every day on focused
tasks. This might be 15-30 minutes or it might be 4 hours (or even more,
depending on the time you choose to commit to this). The point is to
stick with this time <a

<p>You can also focus on specific aspects of anatomy; narrowing down
particular body parts and research and immerse yourself in these areas
to learn all about them.</p>

<p>These are just examples.</p>
<p>Practice through repetition, find and discover new techniques, find
various things to focus on, and draw iterations and versions of the same
subject over and over, just like practicing piano, only through
repetition can you learn the piece well. Practice drawing that subject
in various angles and styles, over and over and over again. Explore and
experiment different methods to broaden your skill sets throughout the
design spectrum. Think about what areas of drawing you are weakest at or
most fearful of doing, and research these areas and make yourself sketch
them over and over.</p>
<p>The point of working with a self-made, rigid schedule is that it
keeps you honest. Every day you’ll be working towards building a
subconscious routine that just sorta happens whether you’re thinking
about it or not.</p>
<p>You might have some days where you can’t make the time to practice
because of an unforeseen circumstance or just being too tired. If that’s
the case just move your drawings to the next day. Or tack on extra time
throughout the week to make up for lost drawing hours.</p>

totally fine, most likely you need to catch up for that lost time, and

to the advice</a>, and you’ll advance quickly. There’s many, many
different areas here to challenge yourself with, don’t be overwhelmed,
tackle one thing at a time, write down your battle plan for what areas
to practice first, make lists, and get started right away.</p>

start focusing your drawing efforts and trying to practice certain
skills. Narrow down specific areas that interest you and any areas you
are weak in.</p>

<p>It cannot be stressed enough: the importance of getting on a
schedule. It is possible to just draw whenever you have free time. But
that sort of loosey-goosey scheduling isn’t how you build consistent
month-over-month progress. Remain regimented, continuous, steady - with
a list of topics, subjects and items to mark off to practice on.</p>

<p>If you stick with it and get into the habit of drawing every single
day, then you’re guaranteed to see improvements. Self-motivation and
perseverance will help you get through the early stages. Learning art
has little to do with inspiration and everything to do with hard work.
Just like working out your muscles, consistency is the key, always!</p>

<p>“It’s not about the journey, it’s not about the destination, it’s
about the person you become on the journey.” - Jimmy Carr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An Article by <em>Clara Lieu</em>, Visual Arts Professor at the
<em>Rhode Island School of Design</em>:</p>
<p>Drawing is a highly complex beast which involves so many different
elements at various skill levels. Rather than get into all of those
details, I'm going to boil it down to four fundamental directives that
will help improve your drawing abilities across all skill levels and
media.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Draw from direct observation<br />

<ul>
<li>This sounds so simple, and yet I'm appalled at how many artists
don't work from direct observation when they are looking to improve
their drawing skills. Photographs may be convenient and easier to work
from, but they're a cheap shortcut that will lead to the development of
all sorts of bad habits. The amount of information that a photograph has
pales in comparison to seeing a subject in real life. This is not to say
that one should never ever in their lifetime work from a photograph; I
work from photographs all the time now.</li>
<li>However, I'm able to do this because I've developed skills based on
many, many years of working from direct observation.</li>
<li>When you work from life, you experience your subject matter in a way
that a photograph could never allow you to: you can touch your subject,
smell it, walk around it, and see the subject within the context of its
environment. This overall sensory experience is vital towards your
understanding of your subject matter and will translate into your
drawing.</li>
<li>Drawing is as much about learning how to see as it is about the
marks that you put on the page. Experiencing your subject in real life
will teach you how to hone your skills in observation. The skills that
you will gain from working from direct observation will tremendously
inform and support your ability to work from all sorts of other
references.</li>
<li><figure>
<img src="./images/unnamed_1307.png" alt="image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice daily<br />

<ul>
<li>Drawing is very similar to athletics. If you were an athlete, you
would have a rigid schedule of training set up that you would adhere to.
Drawing is the same way: it requires serious focus, rigorous training,
and intense physical stamina. Every time you sit down to draw, it's an
opportunity to sharpen your eye, and become more proficient in
coordinating your mind and eye with the physical movements of your arm
and hand. Many people get impatient with drawing and expect results
right away. You have to be committed, and be able to recognize that
improvement is a slow and gradual process. One would never expect to be
an Olympic-level skier after one week of training, the same way you
can't expect to be a master of drawing after working for a few
days.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look at historical drawings
<ul>
<li>Go to the library and check out books (or go <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv%3D47a159505e5d460b%26rlz%3D1C5CHFA_enCA1088CA1088%26sxsrf%3DACQVn0_oJGqQ7h70hmfpL-de1R0BWRB-uw:1709648379474%26q%3Dhistorical%2Bartists%2Bsketches%26tbm%3Disch%26source%3Dlnms%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D2ahUKEwj1quXCqN2EAxXSrokEHfWlDPYQ0pQJegQIEBAB%26biw%3D1637%26bih%3D896%26dpr%3D2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865544525&amp;usg=AOvVaw3MwFyVd5HwcOLgpsGdP6HJ">online</a>)
that feature drawings by historical artists. The drawings that you'll
learn the most from are gesture drawings and quick sketches done in
sketchbooks. In these quick sketches you'll get to see all of the visual
evidence: you get to see all of the mistakes, all of the troubleshooting
that happens in an artist's drawing process. This is what is so unique
about drawing that you won't see in other media like painting and
sculpture -- the opportunity to see traces of an artist's process in a
drawing. Investigate and analyze what kinds of strategies these artists
take in their drawing process and try to use them in your own.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practice gesture drawing<br />

<ul>
<li>If you can do strong gesture drawings, you've already won half the
battle. Gesture drawings are the core of any drawing, they capture the
essence of what a drawing is trying to say in just a few strokes, in
just a few minutes. The first two minutes of a drawing are critical in
that they lay the foundation for the rest of the drawing. It doesn't
matter how polished your drawing is if the initial gesture isn't there
to begin with.</li>
<li><figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image</figcaption>
</figure></li>
<li>By Maaike Scherff</li>
<li>Ideally, one should practice gesture drawing from a nude model, but
if you don't have access to a model, there are plenty of other options.
You can go to a local cafe and sketch people sitting in the cafe, or
draw a bunch of friends who are hanging out. One of my friends always
liked going to the beach to draw because people sit still, and they're
practically naked anyway. I had a peer in art school who used to go to
college parties and draw all of the drunk people sitting around. Get
creative and find as many contexts as possible where you can practice
your gesture drawing.</li>

<li>To create a strong gesture, it's important to keep your arm moving
and circulating throughout the page, moving from top to bottom, side to
side, very quickly. Start very, very light with marks that barely show
on the page. This allows you to make lots of mistakes that will not show
later because they'll be so light. Develop all of the parts of the
drawing together so that you don't neglect any area. Try to aim for
continuous movements and fluid lines rather than fragmenting your lines
into choppy marks. Look at your subject more than you look at your
drawing; your subject is where the information is. Keep your gesture
drawings about two to five minutes in length, any longer than that it's
too easy to get lazy and fall back into bad habits.</li>

<p>A few habits you must motivate yourself in doing before every big
design task, but also to do in general when you are out of work and
waiting on your next job - hone your skills, work on any weaknesses…</p>
<p>Practice your techniques, gather and collect images &amp; materials
from a wide range of subjects, and always explore and experiment
different methods to improve your draftsmanship:</p>
<p><img src="./images/unnamed_1148.jpg" alt="image" /> <img

src="./images/unnamed_392.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>All these were found within minutes of searching online for their
various subjects.</p>
<p>When searching for something, add “drawing” ahead of your
subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drawing drapery</li>
<li>Drawing wings</li>
<li>Drawing mermaid tails</li>
<li>Drawing wolves</li>
<li>Drawing horses</li>
<li>Drawing swords</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s endless the various subjects you can find and focus on for just
a short while.</p>

<p>All the imagery shown above was gathered from Pinterest, as a way to
collect various designs and how-to-draw guides for certain topics.
Creating reference boards like this for yourself is vital for exploring
facets you might be weaker in. Cataloging visual information and saving
hundreds of images in neatly organized folders, will help you to learn
how to design these subjects in the future by having them at your

Productive and Motivated</a></p>
<p>Something to practice &gt; ‘Monk Mode’ — inspired by the disciplined
lifestyle of monks — referring to intense periods of uninterrupted focus
to optimize productivity. It involves hyper-concentration on a single
task and removing all distractions: <a

Take Things Personally</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nothing will serve you better than a strong work ethic. Nothing. And
it's something that you can't teach. You have to be thrown into it,
where you're going to sink or swim.” - Robert Downey Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A work ethic is a personal set of values that determines how any
employee approaches their work. Artists with strong work ethics are
highly motivated and endeavor to produce consistently high-quality
results. If YOU feel like you should have a stronger work ethic, then
realizing this and staying positive about improving yourself is the
first step. Find ways to keep yourself motivated, you will get profound
satisfaction from completed work. Procrastination is very very common
amongst artists, but keep working on yourself, your skills, your
confidence, your goals, and you WILL get better. There’s no guaranteed
method to ensure productivity, there’s no secret formula, you just need
to find and discover what works best for YOU. Because all humans work in
different ways. You just need to push yourself to keep practicing, don’t
wait for anyone or anything.</p>
<p>Always absorb the lessons and life experiences of others:</p>

<h3 id="pitching">Pitching</h3>
<p>Creating, developing, and presenting your own properties and ideas
for an animated series or film is a very big and extensive realm to dive
into. Character Design is only one aspect of this grand venture. To
successfully develop, pitch and sell your own concept is truly the final
frontier and the golden ticket of the entire animation industry, for any
artist/creator. There’s many books and sites out there that can offer
lots of advice on the subject.</p>
<p>You must be ready for the heavy reality that you’ll not only need to
develop the visuals (or find someone to help you do so) but you must
also explore the story development and scriptwriting aspect as well. <a
href="https://youtu.be/YcchrgJgryo&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865554082&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DPrsCmV4TVbARAqGhOQ4W">Storyboarding</a>
is also something to be familiar with, at the very least try it, and
learn about how they are made. Especially for animation, storyboards are
sort of the second half of the writing process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Always, always invest in yourself, invest in your ideas, and in your
passions. Regret can be worse than failure.” - Larry F. Houston</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating a pitch package can take a long time, and depending how much
resources you have, you can create a short and condensed pitch deck that
covers the basic concept and visual style like <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GNbHToaeHoFvFwt55cX8Rp76TTX0qZnD/view?usp%3Ddrive_link&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865554816&amp;usg=AOvVaw3dnmU0ZYI9nj6jMCsS_7QU">this</a>.
Or a long detailed bible that covers all aspects of the character
descriptions, art direction, and story outlines like <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17xj2oFgHdMqiNkn8bhoVU9DWbwjy7ROM/view?usp%3Ddrive_link&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865554998&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VaCCKr25Gxk4rTvgSkUm3">this</a>.</p>

<h4 id="writing-developing">Writing &amp; Developing</h4>
<p>Before you can pitch your idea, you must first develop it, and to
develop a concept, you must assemble a pitch deck, to create this you
must put together some scripts and plot synopsis, and to do this, you
must learn how to write for animation. There’s lots to learn when it
comes to creating worlds, creating characters, and writing for film or
episodic television. Here’s some links with a wealth of information to
get you started…</p>

<p>Story Structure gets complicated to master, here's some strategies to
start with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tell a great story
<ul>
<li>This is easier said than done. But nothing matters if you don’t have
a great story worth telling. A tale you are passionate about. A
screenplay worthy of your creativity and devotion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Master the format
<ul>
<li>Anyone can learn the industry standard for margins &amp; overall
structure of a screenplay. However, you have to master the subtleties of
white space, slug lines, page counts &amp; more. Not to mention the
constant threat of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Mastering
the format liberates your screenplay of distractions and leaves only the
story.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No stage directions
<ul>
<li>You are not the director. Leave out camera shots &amp; notes for
actors. If something must be seen then skillfully describe it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show, don’t tell
<ul>
<li>The story is revealed through actions and characters. Your
exposition shouldn’t be obvious to the reader. Show don’t tell.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get in late, get out early
<ul>
<li>This rule applies to your entire screenplay but also to individual
scenes. Cut out the excess and keep your story focused on what matters
most.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Know your audience
<ul>
<li>Never lose sight of who you are writing for even if it’s yourself.
Every screenplay should be a perfect match for the audience it’s
intended for.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create obstacles
<ul>
<li>Nothing should be easy for your characters. Put them through hell so
people will care when (and if) they succeed. There is no suspense
without obstacles and avoid cheating by giving them convenient
escapes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarity
<ul>
<li>Every sentence should communicate an idea (or more than one idea)
and it should be crystal clear. Only you can describe what your
screenplay is about. Show people the exciting moments that previously
existed only in your imagination. Be clear about your character's
motivations and immerse the reader in your world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your world, your characters
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have the answers, how can you ask the questions that
drive your screenplay? What is your world like? Where did your
characters come from? What is your story about?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Less is more
<ul>
<li>Nearly every rule in this list is related to this rule in some way.
Writing with clarity requires a simplification of descriptions. Hiding
exposition can sometimes require dialogue to be rewritten and often
shortened. Getting into your scenes late and out often, using white
space effectively and rewrites in general all point to this one rule.
Less is more. Keep it in mind at all times. Make every single word
matter and eliminate the ones that slow your screenplay down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write what you know
<ul>
<li>Writing what you know doesn’t necessarily mean you have to write
only what you’ve lived. On the other hand, if you don’t know anything
about sharks and want to write about sharks… Maybe you should go swim
with some sharks! Research is key. A screenwriter is a student of life.
Seek out the answers to better inform your story. You have to know every
detail.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have something to say
<ul>
<li>You’ve got a great story, vivid characters and your structure is
perfect. You still can’t take your screenplay to the next level unless
you have something to say. What does your story mean? What is it truly
about? You have to know the answers to these questions and build them
into every page.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Entertain
<ul>
<li>Above all else, your screenplay has to be entertaining. When reading
each and every scene in your movie ask yourself one question: Is this
entertaining? If the answer is no or not really then you’ve got some
work to do.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Create a Compelling Narrative</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Show, Don't Tell: Don't tell the audience that your character is
great; show it through their actions and reactions to challenges.</li>
<li>Sympathetic vs. Admirable: Focus on making your character engaging
and understandable, not just admirable and perfect.</li>
<li>Balance Strengths and Weaknesses: Give them genuine strengths but
also show what they can't do, and ensure their skills have a logical
explanation.</li>
<li>Avoid universal love: It's unrealistic for every character in a
story to be head-over-heels for the protagonist. Ensure there are
characters who are neutral or even dislike them, which adds depth and
realism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Give Your Character Real Flaws</p>
<ul>
<li>Imperfections: Instead of "cute" flaws like clumsiness, give your
character significant, relatable flaws, such as impatience,
impulsiveness, or a specific bias.</li>
<li>Struggle and Failure: A truly perfect character is boring and
unrelatable. Let your character fail, face setbacks, and even question
their own abilities, which makes their triumphs more earned.</li>
<li>Consequences: Don't let your character get away with everything.
Their mistakes should have tangible, realistic consequences that force
them to learn and grow.</li>
<li>A Mary Sue is the nickname given to a character that is
unrealistically perfect, typically an idealized female, who possesses no
significant flaws, lacks meaningful weaknesses, and is exceptionally
skilled in every area. These characters are often criticized as being
unrealistic, embodying authorial wish-fulfillment or self-insertion, and
existing solely to serve the plot rather than growing through
challenges. The male counterpart is known as a Gary Stu or Marty
Stu.</li>
<li>To avoid writing a Mary Sue, give your character genuine flaws,
allow them to fail, make them work for their goals, and avoid making
them the perfect, universally beloved center of the story. Ground them
in a realistic personality with specific likes and dislikes, provide a
believable backstory that informs their motivations, and ensure
characters who disagree with them are not automatically bad.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Developing an animated show involves several key stages, from initial
concept to final production. This includes brainstorming ideas, crafting
a compelling story, designing characters and environments, and finally,
creating the animation itself. Effective development also requires a
strong understanding of animation principles, storytelling techniques,
and the various stages of the production pipeline.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the process…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Ideation and Story Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Generate a wide range of ideas,
focusing on unique concepts, relatable characters, and engaging
storylines.</li>
<li><strong>Research and Pre-Production:</strong> Conduct thorough
research to refine your ideas, explore potentia audiences, and develop a
strong premise.</li>
<li><strong>Story Structure:</strong> Outline the narrative, including a
clear beginning, rising action, climax, falling action, and
resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Character Development:</strong> Create compelling and
memorable characters with distinct personalities, motivations, and
relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Worldbuilding:</strong> Design the visual and thematic world
of your show, including its environment, atmosphere, and overall
aesthetic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pre-Production:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scriptwriting:</strong> Develop a detailed script that
outlines the dialogue, action, and visual elements of each scene.</li>
<li><strong>Concept Art and Character Design:</strong> Create visual
representations of your characters and key locations.</li>
<li><strong>Storyboard:</strong> Translate the script into a visual
sequence, using panels to map out the action, camera angles, and shot
compositions.</li>
<li><strong>Animatic:</strong> Assemble the storyboard panels into a
rough animation, adding preliminary sound and voice acting to test the
flow and timing of the show.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Production:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animation:</strong> Bring the characters and scenes to life,
using 2D or 3D animation techniques, or stop-motion animation.</li>
<li><strong>Backgrounds &amp; FX:</strong> The environments, sets,
visual effects, and props that surround the characters and the
characters interact with help to make the world they’re in and tell the
story that they are involved with even further in more believable and
tactical ways.</li>
<li><strong>Sound Design:</strong> Add sound effects, music, and voice
acting to enhance the visual experience and create a more immersive
world.</li>
<li><strong>Compositing and Editing:</strong> Combine all the animated
elements, sound, and visual effects to create the final product.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Distribution and Marketing:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pitching:</strong> Develop a compelling pitch to showcase
your show to potential investors, networks, or distributors.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Explore various avenues for
distributing your show, such as television, streaming platforms, or
online video sharing websites.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Promote your show to build an audience
and generate interest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Tailor your show's content, style,
and tone to resonate with your intended audience.</li>
<li><strong>Animation Principles:</strong> Understand the fundamental
principles of animation, such as timing, spacing, squash and stretch,
anticipation, performance, color theory, art direction and how to add
life to your characters through movement and acting.</li>
<li><strong>Production Pipeline:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the
standard stages of animation production and adapt them to your specific
project. What style of art direction and animation style best suits your
world and story? 2D, 3D, Stop-motion, and how will the production design
and technical aspects be developed to match your concept.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Animation is often a very
collaborative process, so be prepared to work with other animators,
writers, designers, and sound designers, music composers and even people
to manage your budgets, schedules and talent resources.</li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="creating-a-pitch">Creating a Pitch</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Break Down Your Concept</strong>
<ul>
<li>Logline: Create a concise one or two sentence summary of your series
that captures its essence and hook.</li>
<li>Synopsis: Write a brief overview of the series, including the main
characters, setting, and overarching themes.</li>
<li>Pilot Script: Prepare a polished pilot episode script, ideally 4
pages long for a 3 min series, or 8-9 pages long for a 7 min series, or
12-14 pages long for a 11 min series, or 24-28 pages long for a 22 min
series. Showcasing your writing style and the tone of the series.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create Support Material
<ul>
<li><strong>Series Bible</strong> - Develop a detailed document that
includes:
<ul>
<li>Character descriptions</li>
<li>Themes, motifs, and arcs</li>
<li>Target audience and market analysis</li>
<li>Episode summaries for the first season (and beyond, if
applicable)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Visual Elements:</strong> Consider including mood boards,
concept art, or reference images that convey the visual style of the
show, if possible - Designs for at least all the primary characters and
environments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Research and Networking</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know Your Audience:</strong> Understand what types of
content the company you’re pitching to is currently producing and what
aligns with their brand.</li>
<li><strong>Networking:</strong> Connect with industry professionals,
attend pitch festivals, or use platforms like LinkedIn to find contacts
at the company you’re pitching to or their production partners.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Craft Your Pitch</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elevator Pitch:</strong> Prepare a short, engaging pitch
that you can deliver quickly. Focus on the unique aspects of your
series. Practice how to summarize the entire world, characters, and main
themes in a speech, under a minute long.</li>
<li><strong>Full Pitch Presentation</strong> - Be ready to present your
series in detail. This would include:
<ul>
<li>The logline and synopsis.</li>
<li>Key themes and character dynamics.</li>
<li>Why it fits with their current content strategy.</li>
<li>Propose original and unique content - Your pitch should focus on
fresh and original content. Netflix seeks distinctive narratives that
stand out in the saturated market of streaming content. Demonstrate
broad appeal and niche interest: Make your content appealing to a wide
audience while catering to specific interests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Practice:</strong> Rehearse your pitch multiple times to
ensure clarity and confidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Find the Right Contacts</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Representation:</strong> It’s often beneficial to have an
agent or manager with connections in the industry. They can help you
navigate the submission process. Eventually, you may be asked for a
Chain of Title and a Certificate of Origin, this is the least fun aspect
of the whole process. These are the assets that prove that YOU are the
author/artist of this original intellectual property. <a

how to produce and collect these materials, as the people you are
pitching to will need evidence that this is indeed your concept if they
wish to proceed with developing the concept further with you.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Submissions:</strong> If you don’t have
representation, research if they have a formal submission process or
look for opportunities through contests or industry events.​​ Often the
company won’t accept unsolicited pitch submissions, unless there’s a
contest or online submission process on their sites to go through. If
you can’t find a way to contact an executive directly, you will need to
find an entertainment lawyer or agent to represent you - Research
reputable literary agencies and entertainment law firms, and reach out
to them with a query letter introducing yourself and your project.
Attend industry events and conferences to network and make connections
with professionals who may be able to represent you or refer you to
others.

<h4 id="pitching-summary">Pitching Summary</h4>
<p>Pitching a series takes lots of preparation, research, and
networking. By presenting a well-developed concept and demonstrating an
understanding of that producer’s vision or studio’s content vision, you
can increase your chances of success. When pitching a TV series keep in
mind that you are pitching a "world". A world in which there are an
endless amount of stories to be told. Then you get to enter a
mini-production phase, to make a sizzle reel, or <a

idea</a> to test out how it looks and feels. Then that gets reviewed by
executives, to see if the proof of concept is ready to go to full
series, or if more development or changes need to happen. There’s also
the art of adapting an already-existing property to be re-made in
animated form, that means you need to learn about <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SFf4Im_SXvg?feature%3Dshare&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1759597865580773&amp;usg=AOvVaw2atwkEP_B-Qw-kvxU6eeS4">option

<p>Remember, they are more interested in YOU, than your actual idea. You
must convince them that if your concept is green lit to go into
production that YOU would be able to handle all the problem-solving
aspects and any technical or creative obstacles that would come your
way. They need to know that YOU would be able to handle the mountain of
responsibility that comes with being the showrunner for your own
series/film. They are not picking your idea because they think it’s a
strong idea for their next animated property. They are picking you
because they believe YOU can develop and follow-through your concept
into full production and successfully complete.</p>

<h4 id="thats-it">That’s it</h4>
<p>If you had fun doing the assignments (in the sense that it felt
creative, informative, liberating, and not a chore to do) then this
might be your calling. Keep pursuing this, keep pushing yourself, keep
practicing, keep applying to animation or video game studios (even if
they don’t have job postings), and you’ll soon find yourself earning a
living doing this work. You can also create characters of your own, in
your own style, and show the stages of progression in your online
portfolio. Stay focused on your tasks and the growth of your skills.
Stay committed to the work, and always remain devoted to the production
you are in. Your efforts will pay off, the growth of your expertise and
your value as an employee will rise the more you dedicate yourself to
the craft!</p>
<p>Repetition is the master of all skill. Always seek out ways to better
yourself, because you’re only in competition with your own self, never
with others- slow, steady, consistent progress is the secret.</p>

<p><strong>Never say:</strong> “How did they do that?” -- <strong>Always

<p>If you would like MORE character design projects to practice various
styles with, simply go back to <strong>Assignments

haven’t tried yet. In this document there’s 32 styles in all, but feel
free to search out other old or modern character designs from all the
various series &amp; movies out there. Delve into as many as you can,

<p>Improve quickly by <strong>copying / drawing-over</strong> &amp;
<strong>breaking down</strong> all the model sheets, concept art,
illustrations, production design images and character poses you can find
- it’s all for educational purposes. It’s the one true way to accelerate
your learning, and improve your draftsmanship. But copy to learn, not to
use. Don’t claim these trace-offs as your own creations, but use them
for practice and self-improvement.</p>
<p>Your brain will inherently know and learn the patterns of shapes,
contours, and forms you draw to create these images, and it will benefit
your instinctive art skills in meaningful ways. Draw and Copy other
people’s work to learn from them, break them down and analyze them, then
you will unconsciously learn how to incorporate their techniques into
your own work.</p>
<p>Then, when creating your <strong>own designs</strong> - DON’T JUST
COPY… If you really like the style of a certain show or illustrator, try
to incorporate aspects of it… without just mimicking the EXACT STYLE.
Try to create a design that FEELS inspired by other things… but it
shouldn’t read as fanart. Trace and Copy the styles you need to learn
from in the beginning, to figure out what makes them work, then draw
your own version. Figure out what aspects of the design style make it
unique and fresh to YOU, then put your own voice in there. With all this
said - always listen to those who make sense to you, follow the code of
those that inspire you, consider the words of advice from <a
